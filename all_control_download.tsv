Evidence-based systematic review: Oropharyngeal dysphagia behavioral treatments. Part IV -- Impact of dysphagia treatment on individuals' postcancer treatments		McCabe, D., Ashford, J., Wheeler-Hegland, K., Frymark, T., Mullen, R., Musson, N., Hammond, C. S., Schooling, T., Davenport and Taylor Memorial Hospital, Bath N. Y.				journal of rehabilitation research & development	journal of rehabilitation research & development	This evidence-based systematic review (EBSR) is part of a series of reviews investigating swallowing behavioral treatments for individuals with dysphagia. This EBSR focuses primarily on individuals with dysphagia postcancer treatments. The seven behavioral interventions under review included three postural interventions (side lying, chin tuck, and head rotation) and four swallowing maneuvers (effortful swallow, Mendelsohn, supraglottic swallow, and super-supraglottic swallow). We systematically searched the dysphagia literature from March 2007 to April 2008. Six studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were evaluated for methodological quality and characterized by research stage. Effect sizes were calculated when possible. All studies included were considered exploratory, with quality-marker scores ranging from 1 to 4 out of 7 possible markers. Five studies examined one or more of the four swallowing maneuvers, and one study addressed the chin-tuck posture. No studies addressed side lying or head rotation. Currently, limited evidence exists from six studies showing the positive effects of behavioral swallowing interventions for populations with structural disorder. Because of the range of structural deficits resulting from cancers and their treatments, further research is needed that evaluates specific intervention effectiveness.			2009				530
Laparoscopic nephrectomy in children: systematic review of transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches		Kim, C., McKay, K. and Docimo, S. G.				urology	urology	OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review of the available medical data concerning laparoscopic nephrectomy in children. For many pediatric urologists, the laparoscopic approach to nephrectomy has become the standard of care. Access can be obtained using a retroperitoneal (RP) or transperitoneal (TP) approach. Previously, debates have argued the advantage of each technique relative to the other. METHODS: We performed a data search through MEDLINE and PubMed to find reports of laparoscopic nephrectomy, nephroureterectomy, and partial nephrectomy in children. We analyzed the operative time, hospital stay, and rate of complication with each approach. Specifically, we assessed the rate of vascular, solid organ, and bowel injuries. RESULTS: We found 51 articles that reported the outcomes of 689 pediatric nephrectomies. Of these, 401 were RP and 288 were TP laparoscopic renal surgeries in children. The mean patient age for RP and TP was 5.4 years and 4.8 years, respectively. The mean operative time was 129 minutes for RP and 154 minutes for TP. The hospital stay was 2.5 days for RP and 2.3 days for TP. The overall complication rate for RP was 4.3% and for TP was 3.5% (P = .58). The number of vascular injuries for RP was 2 and for TP was 0 (P = .12). The number of bowel injuries for RP was 2 and for TP was 1 (P = .68). CONCLUSIONS: According to the available published data, no significant advantage is gained by a RP or TP approach for laparoscopic nephrectomy. Although the operative time for RP was slightly shorter than for TP, the types of cases performed were not directly matched and thus were more challenging to compare. The incidence of vascular and bowel injuries was rare for both approaches. Therefore, the choice of approach should be determined by surgeon preference, patient anatomy, or the procedure to be performed.			2009				403
Effect of medication dosing frequency on adherence in chronic diseases		Saini, S. D., Schoenfeld, P., Kaulback, K. and Dubinsky, M. C.				the american journal of managed care	the american journal of managed care	OBJECTIVE: To systematically review available data on the effect of daily medication dosing frequency on medication adherence in chronic disease states, as assessed by precise medication event monitoring systems (MEMS). STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of relevant literature published between January 1986 and August 2007. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched to identify appropriate studies. Study selection criteria included prospective study design, patient population with quiescent chronic disease, medication intervention prescribed to each treatment arm for at least 6 weeks, and the use of MEMS to measure adherence. Data were extracted on the chronic disease being treated, the frequency of medication dosing, and the proportion of days with correct number of doses. RESULTS: Twenty studies met the selection criteria. All studies reported higher adherence rates in patients using less frequently dosed medications, and these differences were statistically significant (P <.05) in 75% (15 of 20) of studies. For 5 of 6 studies comparing once-daily versus thrice-daily dosing, patients receiving once-daily dosing had 22% to 41% more adherent days compared with patients receiving thrice-daily dosing. For studies comparing once-daily versus twice-daily dosing, patients receiving once-daily dosing had 2% to 44% more adherent days compared with patients receiving twice-daily dosing, with most studies clustering around 13% to 26%. CONCLUSION: Patients are more compliant with once-daily compared with twice-daily or thrice-daily treatment regimens.			2009				717
HIV monotherapy with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors: a systematic review		Bierman, W. F., van Agtmael, M. A., Nijhuis, M., Danner, S. A. and Boucher, C. A.				aids (london, england)	aids (london, england)	OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: Systematic review of all protease inhibitor-monotherapy studies published in peer-reviewed journals or presented at conferences to date. Data of randomized controlled trials were pooled to yield common odds ratios. RESULTS: Twenty-two protease inhibitor-monotherapy studies were identified. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 395 out of 582 (67.9%) patients had undetectable HIV-RNA at the end of follow-up. In the six randomized controlled trials (all lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy), the risk of therapy failure was greater on monotherapy: 121 out of 364 (33.2%) patients on monotherapy against 64 out of 280 (22.9%) patients on HAART [pooled odds ratio 1.48 (95% confidence interval 1.02-2.13, P = 0.037)]. Regarding patients with successfully resuppressed HIV-RNA upon (re-)introducing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) as nonfailures, the risk of therapy failure was comparable: 98 out of 364 (26.9%) against 64 out of 280 (22.9%) patients [odds ratio 1.05 (95% confidence interval 0.72-1.53, P = 0.81)]. CONCLUSION: The overall efficacy of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy is inferior to HAART. The efficacy improves in patients started on monotherapy after suppressed HIV-RNA for at least 6 months. Ten percent of patients have viral rebound with HIV-RNA levels between 50 and 500 copies/ml. Possible explanations are lack of HIV suppression in particular cells or compartments, alternative resistance mechanisms, and nonadherence. Once proven that reintroduction of NRTIs, in patients with loss of viral suppression, is safe and effective, a broader use of simplification of HAART to protease inhibitor monotherapy might be justified. This review supports that the majority of patients with prolonged viral suppression on HAART can successfully be treated with protease inhibitor monotherapy. Arguments for this strategy are NRTI/NNRTI side effects, NRTI/NNRTI resistance, and costs.			2009				75
An update on the treatment of bipolar depression		Azorin, J. M. and Kaladjian, A.				expert opinion on pharmacotherapy	expert opinion on pharmacotherapy	BACKGROUND: Although depression accounts for a large part of the burden associated with bipolar disorder, its drug treatment has been under-studied. OBJECTIVE: To provide the best available evidence supporting the pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted, focusing on randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Despite FDA approval of both the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and quetiapine for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, independent RCTs (i.e., not trials conducted 'under the umbrella' of a drug company) have not found any drug to have antidepressant effects similar to those seen in unipolar depression. A practice-based suggestion, valuable for both short- and long-term treatment, might be to have a background of mood stabilizers and to add drugs, following one of several treatment options, trusting to find a drug with a degree of effectiveness by trial and error. The list of drugs that could be used would include all the current antidepressants, the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and probably quetiapine too. Special features and situations might also influence treatment options.			2009				48
Low-dose oral misoprostol for induction of labor: a systematic review		Kundodyiwa, T. W., Alfirevic, Z. and Weeks, A. D.				obstetrics and gynecology	obstetrics and gynecology	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the efficacy and safety of low-dose oral misoprostol compared with dinoprostone (PGE2), vaginal misoprostol, and oxytocin for labor induction in women with a viable fetus. DATA SOURCES: We conducted electronic database searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for articles published before January 2008 using the keywords misoprostol, labor, induction, randomized controlled trials, dinoprostone, oxytocin, pregnancy, and maternal and fetal side effects. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized controlled trials comparing 20-25 micrograms oral misoprostol with vaginal misoprostol, dinoprostone or oxytocin given to women at 32-42 weeks of gestation for labor induction. From 401 citations identified, results from nine studies were finally analyzed using the Review Manager software. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed and random-effects models. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Nine articles with 2,937 women met the inclusion criteria. The five trials comparing oral misoprostol and dinoprostone showed significantly fewer women requiring cesarean delivery in the misoprostol group (20% compared with 26%; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.96). There were no statistically significant differences in risks of uterine hyperstimulation or need for oxytocin augmentation. Two trials compared oral with vaginal low-dose misoprostol. Women using oral misoprostol were significantly less likely to experience uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes (2% compared with 13%; RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08-0.46), but there were no significant differences in other outcomes. CONCLUSION: Low-dose oral misoprostol solution (20 micrograms) administered every 2 hours seems at least as effective as both vaginal dinoprostone and vaginal misoprostol, with lower rates of cesarean delivery and uterine hyperstimulation, respectively.			2009				426
Tracheal rupture after endotracheal intubation: a literature systematic review		Miñambres, E., Burón, J., Ballesteros, M. A., Llorca, J., Muñoz, P. and González-Castro, A.				european journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the european association for cardio-thoracic surgery	european journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the european association for cardio-thoracic surgery	We aim to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the cases of postintubation tracheal rupture (PiTR) published in the literature, with the aim of determining the risk factors that contribute to tracheal rupture during endotracheal intubation. A further objective has been to determine the ideal treatment for this condition (surgical repair or conservative management). A MEDLINE review of cases of tracheal rupture after intubation published in the English language and a review of the references in the articles found. The articles included were those that reported at least the demographic data (age and sex), the treatment performed, and the outcome. Those papers that did not detail the above variables were excluded. The search found 50 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. These studies included 182 cases of postintubation tracheal rupture. The overall mortality was 22% (40 patients). A statistical analysis was performed determining the relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and/or statistical significance. The analysis was performed on the overall group and after dividing into 2 subgroups: patients in whom the lesion was detected intraoperatively, and other patients. Patient age (p=0.015) and emergency intubation (RR=3.11; 95% CI, 1.81-5.33; p=0.001) were variables associated with an increased mortality. In those patients in whom the PiTR was detected outside the operating theatre (delayed diagnosis), emergency intubation (RR=3.05; 95% CI, 1.69-5.51; p<0.0001), the absence of subcutaneous emphysema (RR=2.17; 95% CI, 1.25-4; p=0.001), and surgical treatment (RR=2.09; 95% CI, 1.08-4.07; p=0.02) were associated with an increased mortality. In addition, age (p=0.1) and male gender (RR=1.89; 95% CI, 0.98-3.63; p=0.13) showed a clear trend towards an increased mortality. PiTR is an uncommon condition but carries a high morbidity and mortality. Emergency intubation is the principal risk factor, increasing the risk of death threefold compared to elective intubation. Conservative treatment is associated with a better outcome. However, the group of patients who would benefit from surgical treatment has not been fully defined. Further studies are required to evaluate the best treatment options.			2009				553
Interventions to improve medication-adherence after transplantation: a systematic review		De Bleser, L., Matteson, M., Dobbels, F., Russell, C. and De Geest, S.				transplant international : official journal of the european society for organ transplantation	transplant international : official journal of the european society for organ transplantation	Reports of interventions to improve adherence to medical regimens in solid organ transplant recipients are scarce. A systematic review identified 12 intervention studies. These studies focused on renal, heart, and liver transplant recipients. Five reports used randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs. Sample sizes varied between 18 and 110 subjects. The interventions are difficult to evaluate and categorize because of brief descriptions of intervention details. Of the 12 studies identified in this review, only five studies found a statistically significant improvement in at least one medication-adherence outcome with the intervention. In general, most included a combination of patient-focused cognitive/educational, counseling/behavioral, and psychologic/affective dimensions. Eight studies intervened at the healthcare provider, healthcare setting or healthcare system level, but showed a limited improvement in adherence. No single intervention proved to be superior at increasing medication-adherence in organ transplantation, but a combination of interventions in a team approach for the chronic disease management of organ transplant patients may be effective in a long-term perspective. In conclusion, finding the most effective combination of interventions to enhance adherence is vital. Utilizing an RCT design and adhering to the CONSORT guidelines can lead to higher quality studies and possibly more effective intervention studies to enhance medication-adherence.			2009				184
Systematic review of minimally invasive pancreatic resection		Briggs, C. D., Mann, C. D., Irving, G. R., Neal, C. P., Peterson, M., Cameron, I. C. and Berry, D. P.				journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the society for surgery of the alimentary tract	journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the society for surgery of the alimentary tract	BACKGROUND: Pancreatic resection is associated with a significant morbidity. Efforts to reduce hospital stay and enhance recovery have seen the introduction of minimally invasive surgical techniques. This article reviews the current published literature on the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery of the pancreas. METHODS: An electronic search of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed from 1996 to May 2008 to identify all relevant publications; studies meeting predefined inclusion criteria were retrieved and analyzed using a standardized protocol. Data on the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery of the pancreas were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Of 565 abstracts reviewed, 39 studies were identified as eligible for inclusion. There were 37 case series and two case control studies. Compared with open pancreatic surgery, minimally invasive pancreatic resection is similar in terms of morbidity and mortality. Blood loss and length of stay are decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic distal pancreatic resection and enucleation of insulinoma appear to be safe procedures with reduced hospital stay, though morbidity remains significant. The evidence for laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is in its infancy, but the authors feel it is unlikely that many centers will achieve sufficient case load to make the introduction of minimally invasive resection feasible.			2009				97
Efficacy of Crude Marijuana and Synthetic Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol as Treatment for Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: A Systematic Literature Review		Cotter, J.				oncology nursing forum	oncology nursing forum	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the research to determine whether oral delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and smoked marijuana are effective treatments for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and to evaluate side effects and patient preference of these treatments.DATA SOURCES: Original research, review articles, and other published articles in CINAHL(R), MEDLINE(R), and Cochrane Library databases.DATA SYNTHESIS: Cannabinoids are effective in controlling CINV, and oral THC and smoked marijuana have similar efficacy. However, smoked marijuana may not be accessible or safe for all patients with cancer. Also, these drugs have a unique side-effect profile that may include alterations in motor control, dizziness, dysphoria, and decreased concentration.CONCLUSIONS: This synthesis shows that cannabinoids are more effective than placebo and comparable to antiemetics such as prochlorperazine and ondansetron for CINV.Implications for Nursing: Nurses should feel supported by the literature to recommend oral synthetic THC as a treatment for CINV to their patients and physician colleagues. Nurses should be cognizant of the side-effect profile for this medication and provide appropriate patient education.			2009				162
Implementation of integrated care for patients with cancer: a systematic review of interventions and effects		Ouwens, M., Hulscher, M., Hermens, R., Faber, M., Marres, H., Wollersheim, H. and Grol, R.				international journal for quality in health care : journal of the international society for quality in health care / isqua	international journal for quality in health care : journal of the international society for quality in health care / isqua	PURPOSE: To review integrated care interventions and their effects on the quality of care for patients with cancer. DATA SOURCES: Search in Medline and Cochrane Library databases from January 1996 to October 2006. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials and controlled before-after studies in which the intervention focused on at least one of the three principles of integrated care: patient-centredness, organization of care and multidisciplinary care. DATA EXTRACTION AND RESULTS: Of the 1397 references, 33 studies were included and analysed. No study focused on all three principles of integrated care: 16 studies focused on patient-centredness (48%), 14 on the organization of care (42%), 1 on multidisciplinary care and 2 on both patient-centredness and organization of care. There was a large variation in interventions reported and in outcomes used for evaluation. Effective interventions to improve patient-centredness are the 'provision of an audiotape of the consultation to the patient', 'provision of information to patients' and 'use of a decision aid'. Effective interventions to improve the organization of care can be 'follow-up' and 'case management', especially by nurses and 'one-stop clinics'. CONCLUSION: To improve integrated care for patients with cancer, a multicomponent intervention programme is required focusing on patients, professionals and the organization of care. The promising interventions found in this review should be part of this programme. This programme should be evaluated using rigorous methods and unequivocal outcome measures linked to the intervention.			2009				622
A systematic review of compression hosiery for uncomplicated varicose veins		Palfreyman, S. J. and Michaels, J. A.				phlebology / venous forum of the royal society of medicine	phlebology / venous forum of the royal society of medicine	OBJECTIVE: Compression hosiery is widely used in the prevention and management of symptoms related to varicose veins. However, there are still gaps and questions in relation to its benefit. This review seeks to examine the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of compression hosiery in the treatment of varicose veins. METHOD: Prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating compression hosiery in the treatment of varicose veins were sought. Where RCTs were unavailable other evidence was included. Studies were included if they evaluated the application of compression to patients with a diagnosis of varicose veins. Twelve electronic bibliographic databases and 18 internet-based research resources were searched. Inclusion or exclusion of trials was decided by two reviewers acting independently. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 25 studies. Eleven were RCTs or systematic reviews, 12 non-randomized studies and two guidelines. No consensus was found regarding the class of compression needed for the effective management of varicose veins. Wearing compression improved symptom management, but could be confounded by the exclusion of high number of non-compliant patients within the trials. Wearing compression to slow the progression, or prevent the reoccurrence of varicose veins could not be supported by the current published evidence. CONCLUSION: The evidence for the benefit of compression hosiery for varicose veins was equivocal. The published literature was often contradictory and had methodological flaws.			2009				625
Interventions for obstructive sleep apnea in children: a systematic review		Kuhle, S., Urschitz, M. S., Eitner, S. and Poets, C. F.				sleep medicine reviews	sleep medicine reviews	BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by habitual snoring, heavy breathing, sleep-related hypoxia and arousals from sleep, and is found in approximately 3% of children. OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy of medical, behavioral, mechanical and surgical interventions in improving OSA in children. METHODS: Bibliographic databases, relevant conference proceedings and trial registers were searched. Randomized controlled trials assessing interventions in children with objectively diagnosed OSA (as per polysomnography; apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI) > or = 1/h) were considered. RESULTS: The search identified 1690 potentially relevant studies. The five trials that met the inclusion criteria investigated seven different interventions (intranasal steroids, adenotonsillectomy, maxillary distraction, temperature-controlled radiofrequency ablation, oral appliances, continuous and bilevel positive airway pressure therapy). Intranasal steroids had a significant advantage over placebo in decreasing the AHI (one study). Temperature-controlled radiofrequency ablation and adenotonsillectomy were equally effective in reducing the RDI (one study). Continuous and bilevel positive airway pressure therapy was equally effective in reducing the AHI (one study). There was insufficient evidence to support the use of oral appliances. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a broad array of treatment options for OSA, there is limited evidence to support their use. More research is needed before general recommendations can be made.			2009				425
Exceptionally high initial seizure threshold in a catatonic patient treated with electroconvulsive therapy		van Waarde, J. A., Muller, M. E., Verwey, B. and van der Mast, R. C.				the journal of ect	the journal of ect	OBJECTIVES: Seizure threshold in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is generally defined as the smallest electrical stimulus dose that produces a generalized seizure of at least 25 to 30 seconds on electroencephalography. Seizure thresholds vary considerably among patients, and some patients have an exceptionally high initial seizure threshold. We describe a patient with catatonia who showed an initial seizure threshold exceeding 500 milliCoulombs. The literature was searched for other reports on this phenomenon. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using MedLine from 1966 to January 2008 and PsychINFO (2007), cross-referencing ECT and (excessively high) seizure threshold, as well as standard works on ECT. The literature was scrutinized for reports on high initial seizure threshold and associated demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Besides our patient, 6 articles were found reporting on 9 severely depressed, mostly elderly patients (aged 45-85 years; 5 males, 2 females; 2 persons with unknown sex) with excessive initial seizure thresholds ranging from 335 to 896 milliCoulombs (mC), and most with cardiovascular compromise. Strategies to lower seizure thresholds in ECT included manipulation of stimulus parameters, adjustment of anesthetics, and augmentation with proconvulsant agents. CONCLUSIONS: Because reports on exceptionally high initial seizure thresholds in ECT are rare, no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding its possible risk factors and management. However, since high initial seizure thresholds can complicate ECT, it is clinically important to further investigate this phenomenon.			2009				848
Lumbar interlaminar epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain: a systematic review		Parr, A. T., Diwan, S. and Abdi, S.				pain physician	pain physician	BACKGROUND: Low back pain with or without lower extremity pain is the most common problem among chronic pain disorders with significant economic, societal, and health impact. Epidural injections are one of the most commonly performed interventions in the United States in managing chronic low back pain. However the evidence is highly variable among different techniques utilized - namely interlaminar, caudal, transforaminal - and for various conditions, namely - intervertebral disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and discogenic pain without disc herniation or radiculitis. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids in managing various types of chronic low back and lower extremity pain emanating as a result of disc herniation or radiculitis, spinal stenosis, and chronic discogenic pain. METHODS: Review of the literature and methodologic quality assessment were performed according to the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group Criteria as utilized for interventional techniques for randomized trials and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria for observational studies. The level of evidence was classified as Level I, II, or III based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for therapeutic interventions. Data sources included relevant literature of the English language identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to November 2008, and manual searches of bibliographies of known primary and review articles. Results of analysis were performed for multiple conditions separately. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was pain relief (short-term relief = up to 6 months and long-term > 6 months). Secondary outcome measures were improvement in functional status, psychological status, return to work, and reduction in opioid intake. RESULTS: The available literature included only blind epidural injections without fluoroscopy. The indicated evidence is positive (Level II-2) for short-term relief of pain of disc herniation or radiculitis utilizing blind interlaminar epidural steroid injections with lacking of evidence with Level III for long-term relief for disc herniation and radiculitis. The evidence is lacking with Level III for short and long-term relief for spinal stenosis and discogenic pain without radiculitis or disc herniation utilizing blind epidural injections. LIMITATIONS: The limitations of this study include paucity of literature, lack of quality evidence, lack of fluoroscopic procedures, and lack of applicable evidence in contemporary interventional pain management practices. CONCLUSION: The evidence based on this systematic review is limited for blind interlaminar epidurals in managing all types of pain except for short-term relief of pain secondary to disc herniation and radiculitis. This evidence does not represent contemporary interventional pain management practices and also the evidence may not be extrapolated to fluoroscopically directed lumbar interlaminar epidural injections.			2009				632
Systematic review: secondary prevention with band ligation, pharmacotherapy or combination therapy after bleeding from oesophageal varices		Cheung, J., Zeman, M., van Zanten, S. V. and Tandon, P.				alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	BACKGROUND: Variable methods are available for secondary prevention after oesophageal variceal bleeding (EVB). AIM: To compare band ligation (BL), pharmacotherapy (PT) and BL+PT for EVB secondary prevention. METHODS: A systematic search of databases, references and meeting abstracts was conducted for randomized trials of BL, PT or BL+PT. The outcomes were mortality, rebleeding and adverse events. A random-effects model was used for meta-analyses. RESULTS: Twelve trials were included (6 BL vs. PT, 4 BL+PT vs. BL, 2 BL+PT vs. PT). All trials used beta-blockers +/- isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) as PT. Mortality was not significantly different among trials. Rebleeding was not significantly different for BL vs. PT (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73-1.37). BL reduced rebleeding compared with PT for trials with mean beta-blocker dose <80 mg/day (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.91). There were nonsignificant differences in rebleeding for BL+PT vs. BL (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.31-1.08) and BL+PT vs. PT (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.03). There was no difference in adverse events between BL vs. PT, but was higher with BL+PT vs. BL. CONCLUSION: Band ligation and PT alone are comparable for secondary prevention of rebleeding after EVB. Further trials with adequate PT dosing are required to determine the efficacy of combination BL+PT therapy.			2009				134
A systematic review of integrated use of disease-management interventions in asthma and COPD		Lemmens, K. M., Nieboer, A. P. and Huijsman, R.				respiratory medicine	respiratory medicine	BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of multiple interventions in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of multiple interventions as compared to single interventions or usual care on health outcomes and health care utilisation within the context of integrated disease management in asthma and COPD. METHODS: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library (1995-May 2008) were searched for controlled trials. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Meta-analyses were performed on quality of life and health care utilisation data. Furthermore, the effects of multiple interventions versus single interventions and usual care were assessed qualitatively. RESULTS: Of the 36 studies included, 17 targeted double interventions (patient-related and organisational interventions); 19 studies performed triple interventions (patient-related, professional-directed and organisational interventions). They were heterogeneous in terms of (combinations of) interventions, outcomes measured, study design and setting. Pooled data showed that studied disease management programmes significantly improved quality of life on several domains. Patients within triple intervention programmes had less chance of at least one hospital admission compared with usual care. No significant effects were found in number of emergency department visits. Qualitative analyses revealed positive trends on process improvements and satisfaction. Inconclusive results were reported on symptoms; no effects were found in lung function. CONCLUSION: In spite of the heterogeneity of disease management studies in asthma and COPD care, this review showed promising improvements in quality of life and reductions in hospitalisations, especially for triple intervention programmes.			2009				454
Systematic review of the effects of exercise therapy on the upper extremity of patients with spinal-cord injury		Kloosterman, M. G. M., Snoek, G. J., Jannink, M. J. A. and Center for Human Movement Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen University of Groningen Groningen The Netherlands				spinal cord	spinal cord	Objective:To assess the effects of exercise therapy (ET) on motor control and functional ability of the upper extremity in patients with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI).Methods:An extensive systematic literature search in five databases was performed to identify clinical and (randomized) controlled trials, evaluating the effects of ET on motor control and functional ability in patients with SCI. The methodological quality of the selected studies was systematically assessed by three reviewers.Results:Eight studies were included. Seven had good-to-fair methodological quality, six reported positive effects of ET on motor control (for example, muscle strength or muscle grade) and four also reported positive effects on functional ability. Five of these studies focused on patients with long-lasting SCI. A great variety of therapeutic approaches were applied, even within ET there was a wide range of training characteristics.Conclusion:Although ET is a cornerstone in the treatment of the upper extremity in patients with SCI, only a small number of studies were included in the present review. Most of the included studies reported a positive effect of ET on upper extremity motor control and functional ability in SCI patients. As ET is effective in patients with SCI in the chronic stage, this might have implications for the follow up and further treatment of these patients. Future studies should be more specific in describing the characteristics of ET to verify that the ET is in accordance with the current standards for training and motor relearning.Spinal Cord (2009) 47, 196-203; doi:10.1038/sc.2008.113; published online 30 September 2008.			2009				408
Fulvestrant for systemic therapy of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women: a systematic review		Flemming, J., Madarnas, Y. and Franek, J. A.				breast cancer research and treatment	breast cancer research and treatment	A systematic review was undertaken to examine all available evidence to develop and support clinical recommendations regarding the use of fulvestrant (Faslodex((R))) as systemic therapy of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. MEDLINE, EMBASE, American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting proceedings, San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposia proceedings, and the Cochrane Library were searched through to April of 2008 for reports of randomized controlled trials that met established inclusion criteria. Four relevant Phase III trials were available for inclusion based on established criteria. Three of four Phase III superiority trials found no significant difference between fulvestrant and control, either anastrozole or exemestane, across efficacy and safety endpoints following prior endocrine therapy failure, with two trials further confirming non-inferiority of fulvestrant to anastrozole retrospectively. Fulvestrant can therefore be considered as alternative therapy to anastrozole or exemestane in postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has recurred on prior adjuvant endocrine therapy or progressed on prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease. There are, however, important methodological concerns across reviewed trials that should be taken under consideration as they may limit the strength of such a conclusion.			2009				238
Systematic review of endoscopic treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease		Chen, D., Barber, C., McLoughlin, P., Thavaneswaran, P., Jamieson, G. G. and Maddern, G. J.				the british journal of surgery	the british journal of surgery	BACKGROUND: The aim of this review was to assess the safety and efficacy of endoscopic procedures for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: Literature databases including Medline, Embase and PubMed were searched up to May 2006 without language restriction. Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized comparative studies with at least ten patients in each study arm, and case series studies of at least ten patients, were included. RESULTS: A total of 33 studies examining seven endoscopic procedures (Stretta procedure, Bard EndoCinch, Wilson-Cook Endoscopic Suturing Device, NDO Plicator, Enteryx, Gatekeeper Reflux Repair System and Plexiglas) were included in the review. Of the three procedures that were tested against sham controls (Stretta procedure, Bard EndoCinch and Enteryx), patient outcomes in the treatment group were either as good as, or significantly better than, those of control patients in terms of heartburn symptoms, quality of life and medication usage. However, for the two procedures that were tested against laparoscopic fundoplication (Stretta) procedure and Bard EndoCinch), outcomes for patients in the endoscopic group were either as good as, or inferior to, those for the laparoscopic group. CONCLUSION: At present there is insufficient evidence to determine the safety and efficacy of endoscopic procedures for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, particularly in the long term.			2009				130
Meta-analysis of ablation of atrial flutter and supraventricular tachycardia		Spector, P., Reynolds, M. R., Calkins, H., Sondhi, M., Xu, Y., Martin, A., Williams, C. J. and Sledge, I.				the american journal of cardiology	the american journal of cardiology	The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of typical atrial flutter (AFL) and atrioventricular node-dependent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in adult patients. Medline and EMBASE were searched (1990 to 2007) for all study design trials of RFA. Data relating to single- and multiple-procedure success, arrhythmia recurrence, repeat ablation, adverse events, and death were extracted. For RFA in AFL, 18 primary studies with 22 treatment arms and 1,323 patients were identified. Single-procedure success for AFL was 91.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88.4% to 94.9%). Multiple-procedure success was 97.0% (95% CI 94.7% to 99.4%). Postablation arrhythmia was noted in 13.2% of patients (95% CI 7.5% to 18.9%), while repeat ablation was reported in 8% (95% CI 4.5% to 11.4%). For RFA of SVT, 39 primary studies with 49 treatment arms in 7,693 patients with accessory pathways and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia were identified. Single-procedure success for SVT was 93.2% (95% CI 90.8% to 95.5%). Multiple-procedure success was 94.6% (95% CI 92.4% to 96.9). Postablation arrhythmia was noted in 5.6% patients (95% CI 4.1% to 7.2%). Repeat ablation occurred in 6.5% (95% CI 4.7% to 8.3%). For AFL studies, all-cause mortality was 0.6%, and adverse events were reported in 0.5% of patients. For SVT studies, all-cause mortality was 0.1%, and adverse events were reported in 2.9% of patients. In conclusion, studies of RFA for the treatment of patients with AFL and SVT report high efficacy rates and low rates of complications.			2009				775
60 Million non-facility births: who can deliver in community settings to reduce intrapartum-related deaths?		Darmstadt, G. L., Lee, A. C., Cousens, S., Sibley, L., Bhutta, Z. A., Donnay, F., Osrin, D., Bang, A., Kumar, V., Wall, S. N., Baqui, A. and Lawn, J. E.				international journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the international federation of gynaecology and obstetrics	international journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the international federation of gynaecology and obstetrics	BACKGROUND: For the world's 60 million non-facility births, addressing who is currently attending these births and what effect they have on birth outcomes is a key starting point toward improving care during childbirth. OBJECTIVE: We present a systematic review of evidence for the effect of community-based cadres-community-based skilled birth attendants (SBAs), trained traditional birth attendants (TBAs), and community health workers (CHWs)-in improving perinatal and intrapartum-related outcomes. RESULTS: The evidence for providing skilled birth attendance in the community is low quality, consisting of primarily before-and-after and quasi-experimental studies, with a pooled 12% reduction in all cause perinatal mortality (PMR) and a 22%-47% reduction in intrapartum-related neonatal mortality (IPR-NMR). Low/moderate quality evidence suggests that TBA training may improve linkages with facilities and improve perinatal outcomes. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of TBA training showed a 30% reduction in PMR, and a meta-analysis demonstrated an 11% reduction in IPR-NMR. There is moderate evidence that CHWs have a positive impact on perinatal-neonatal outcomes. Meta-analysis of CHW packages (2 cluster randomized controlled trials, 2 quasi-experimental studies) showed a 28% reduction in PMR and a 36% reduction in early neonatal mortality rate; one quasi-experimental study showed a 42% reduction in IPR-NMR. CONCLUSION: Skilled childbirth care is recommended for all pregnant women, and community strategies need to be linked to prompt, high-quality emergency obstetric care. CHWs may play a promising role in providing pregnancy and childbirth care, mobilizing communities, and improving perinatal outcomes in low-income settings. While the role of the TBA is still controversial, strategies emphasizing partnerships with the health system should be further considered. Innovative community-based strategies combined with health systems strengthening may improve childbirth care for the rural poor, help reduce gross inequities in maternal and newborn survival and stillbirth rates, and provide an effective transition to higher coverage for facility births.			2009				175
Epilepsy surgery provides new insights in retinotopic organization of optic radiations. A systematic review		van Baarsen, K. M., Porro, G. L., Wittebol-Post, D. and Department of Ophthalmology, Utrecht University Medical Centre Utrecht The Netherlands K. M. vanBaarsen umcutrecht nl				current opinion in ophthalmology	current opinion in ophthalmology	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Visual field defects (VFDs) produced by temporal lobe resections provide valuable information on the retinotopic organization of the optic radiations. The results of this systematic review of the literature will be translated into a revised--and evidence-based--map of the retinotopic anatomy of the anterior optic radiations. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies provide best evidence by combining automatic static perimetry and modern imaging techniques. VFDs occur in 83% of patients undergoing temporal lobectomy. There is a significant correlation between size of resection and amount of VFD. Most defects appear incongruous. Macular involvement is seen in more than 50% of cases. The inferolateral defect border is of a sloping nature and sometimes crosses the horizontal meridian. On the basis of these findings, the classical theory on the retinotopic anatomy of the optic radiation should be revised. SUMMARY: This article systematically reviews the literature on VFDs after temporal lobe resection. Frequency, size, congruity, macular involvement and defect borders are related to size of resection. The classical theory on the retinotopic organization of the anterior optic radiations should be revised.			2009				832
Probiotics for the treatment of eczema: a systematic review		Boyle, R. J., Bath-Hextall, F. J., Leonardi-Bee, J., Murrell, D. F. and Tang, M. L.				clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the british society for allergy and clinical immunology	clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the british society for allergy and clinical immunology	BACKGROUND: Probiotics have been proposed as a treatment for eczema, but the results of intervention trials have been mixed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics for treating eczema by performing a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). DESIGN: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, LILACS, ISI Web of Science, the reference lists of articles, ongoing clinical trial registers and conference proceedings. RCTs of live orally ingested microorganisms for the treatment of eczema were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Twelve trials (781 participants) were identified. Meta-analysis of data from five of these trials showed that there was no significant reduction in eczema symptoms with probiotic treatment compared with placebo (mean difference -0.90 points on a 20-point visual analogue scale; 95% confidence interval -2.84, 1.04). Meta-analysis of data from seven trials showed no significant difference in investigator rated eczema severity between probiotic and placebo treatments. Subgroup analysis by eczema severity or presence of atopy did not identify a specific population in which probiotic treatment was effective. There was significant heterogeneity between studies; however, the results of three studies that used the same probiotic strain were concordant. The adverse events search identified case reports of sepsis and bowel ischaemia caused by probiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, probiotics cannot be recommended for treating eczema. The heterogeneity between studies may be attributable to probiotic strain-specific effects, which means that novel probiotic strains may still have a role in eczema management.			2009				91
Skin care and skin protection in preterm babies [Dutch]		Körner, A., Dinten-Schmid, B., Stoffel, L., Hirter, K. and Käppeli, S.				pflege	pflege	The skin of preterm infants is anatomically and physiologically premature. This quality of the skin as well as the need for intensive monitoring and treatment/care represent additional stress factors for the integrity of the babies' skin. The babies have an increased vulnerability and risk of skin injuries. Therefore, during the first two to three weeks of life observation of the premature skin is of utmost importance. Ritualistic activities have to be questioned. This is particularly true for infants who are born before 28 weeks of pregnancy. This systematic literature review investigates the effectiveness of nursing interventions in the skin care and protection of the premature infants born earlier than the 32nd week of pregnancy. A systematic literature-search in different databases addressed the following topics: Skin-assessment, selection and use of adhesives, skin care with emollients, and body cleaning (wash interval). Despite certain methodological problems with some of the studies included in this review the following results can be formulated: Based on altered infant behaviour and the skin's continuously high population of germs the interval of bathing should be enhanced to four days. During the first two to four weeks of life the application of sun flower oil is recommended. It has a disinfecting effect and is relatively cheap. Potential preventive or protective dressings of the skin are recommended. Similarly both the utilisation of a valid skin assessment instrument and of preventive measures are inevitable. Conclusion: Evidence-based knowledge of the needs and care of premature skin could reduce complications during the neonatal phase and therefore health care costs. The implementation of a standardised, evidence-based skin care guideline could raise the health professionals' awareness in of skin care needs in this vulnerable patient group.			2009				413
Role of prophylactic surgical ligation of patent ductus arteriosus in extremely low birth weight infants: Systematic review and implications for clinical practice		Mosalli, R., Alfaleh, K. and Paes, B.				annals of pediatric cardiology	annals of pediatric cardiology	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic surgical ligation of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) on mortality and morbidity of preterm infants weighing less than 1000 g at birth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study conducted a systematic search of available database from 1996-2008. Retrieved articles were assessed for eligibility and data was abstracted independently by two reviewers. Decisions to include studies for review and the methodological quality of included studies were asssessed in duplicate based on predetermined criteria. No language restrictions were applied. RESULTS: Only one eligible study that enrolled 84 extremely low birth weight infants was identified. Prophylactic surgical ligation of PDA resulted in a statistically significant reduction of severe stage II or III necrotizing enterocolitis, [RR 0.25, 95% CI (0.08, 0.83), P value 0.02, number needed to treat 5]. The study, however, found no statistically significant difference in mortality, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and retinopathy of prematurity. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence does not support the use of prophylactic surgical ligation of PDA in the management of the preterm infants.			2009				571
Discharge planning in mental health care: a systematic review of the recent literature		Steffen, S., Kösters, M., Becker, T. and Puschner, B.				acta psychiatrica scandinavica	acta psychiatrica scandinavica	OBJECTIVE: To determine and estimate the efficacy of discharge planning interventions in mental health care from in-patient to out-patient treatment on improving patient outcome, ensuring community tenure, and saving costs. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis identified studies through an electronic search on the basis of defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and extracted data. RESULTS: Of eleven studies included, six were randomised controlled trials, three were controlled clinical trials, and two were cohort studies. The discharge planning strategies used varied widely, most were limited to preparation of discharge during in-patient treatment. Pooled risk ratios were 0.66 (95% CI = 0.51 to 0.84; P < 0.001) for hospital readmission rate, and 1.25 (1.07 to 1.47; P < 0.001) for adherence to out-patient treatment. Effect sizes (Hedge's g) were -0.25 (-0.45 to -0.05; P = 0.02) for mental health outcome, and 0.11(-0.05 to 0.28; NS) for quality of life. CONCLUSION: Discharge planning interventions are effective in reducing rehospitalisation and in improving adherence to aftercare among people with mental disorders.			2009				788
Mechanical compression versus subcutaneous heparin therapy in postoperative and posttrauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Eppsteiner, R. W., Shin, J. J., Johnson, J. and van Dam, R. M.				world journal of surgery	world journal of surgery	BACKGROUND: The risk of postoperative venous thromboembolic disease is as high as 30%, with an associated fatality risk of 1%. Therefore, prophylaxis is essential, but the optimal regimen remains controversial. This study was designed to systematically review and quantitatively summarize the impact of mechanical compression versus subcutaneous heparin on venous thromboembolic disease and posttreatment bleeding in postsurgical and posttrauma patients. METHODS: Computerized searches of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through November 2008 were performed and supplemented with manual searches. We included studies that had: (1) a patient population undergoing surgery or admitted immediately posttrauma, (2) a randomized comparison of prophylaxis with mechanical compression versus subcutaneous heparin, (3) outcome measured in terms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or bleeding. RESULTS: Two reviewers independently extracted data from the original articles, which represented 16 studies, including a total of 3,887 subjects. Meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model. The pooled relative risk for mechanical compression compared with subcutaneous heparin was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72, 1.61) for DVT and 1.03 (95% CI 0.48, 2.22) for PE. Mechanical compression was associated with a significantly reduced risk of postoperative bleeding compared with subcutaneous heparin (risk ratio 0.47; 95% CI 0.31, 0.70). Subgroup analyses by heparin type suggested that low molecular weight heparin may reduce risk of DVT compared with compression (relative risk 1.80; 95% CI 1.16, 2.79) but remains similarly associated with an increased risk of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the overall bleeding risk profile favors the use of compression over heparin, with the benefits in term of venous thromboembolic disease prophylaxis being similar between groups. Subgroup analyses suggest that low molecular weight heparin may have a differential effect; this observation should be further evaluated in future studies.			2010				215
The effectiveness and active ingredients of mutual support groups for family caregivers of people with psychotic disorders: a literature review		Chien, W. T. and Norman, I.				international journal of nursing studies	international journal of nursing studies	OBJECTIVES: To explore the literature through a systematic search to assess the effectiveness of mutual support groups for family caregivers of people with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. METHODS: This review of the research literature was based on the procedures suggested by the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (2001) Report Number 4 in the UK [National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2001. Undertaking Systematic Reviews of Research on Effectiveness: CRD's Guidance for those Carrying out or Commissioning Reviews (CRD Report Number 4). 2nd ed., University of York, York, UK]. A combined free-text and thesaurus approach was used to search relevant research studies within electronic databases, including Medline, Embase, CINAHL, OVID full-text, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, the British Nursing Index, the NHS National Research register, and System for Info on Grey literature for the period 1980-2007. Reference lists of all retrieved literature were also searched to identify studies that may have been missed. Twenty-five research studies were selected for inclusion in the analysis on the basis that they were either family led or professional-facilitated support group programmes for family caregivers of people with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. RESULTS: The review identified that most studies on this group programme used qualitative, exploratory cross-sectional surveys and quasi-experimental study designs (n=19); six were experimental studies or randomised controlled trials. There were only a few small-scale, single-centre controlled trials with the findings supporting the significant positive effects of mutual support groups on families' and patients' psychosocial well-being. A number of non-experimental studies conducted in Western countries reported benefits of group participation up to 1 year, such as increased knowledge about the illness, reduced burden and distress, and enhanced coping ability and social support. However, many of these studies lacked rigorous control and did not use standardised and valid instruments as outcome measures or schedule follow-up to examine the long-term effects of support groups on families and/or patients. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing recognition of benefits from mutual support, this review highlights the dearth of evidence for the effects and active ingredients of mutual support groups. Mutual support may have significant impacts on long-term psychosocial and nursing interventions for both patients with severe mental illness and their families in community mental health care. Further research is recommended to investigate the therapeutic components and effects of mutual support groups for family caregivers of people with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders across cultures.			2009				135
A systematic review of the efficacy of globus pallidus stimulation in the treatment of Parkinson's disease		Andrade, P., Carrillo-Ruiz, J. D. and Jiménez, F.				journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the neurosurgical society of australasia	journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the neurosurgical society of australasia	The aim of this study was to systematically review the data published on deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in Parkinson's disease (PD), and to determine its efficacy and optimal stimulation parameters. Only 22 of 4,648 articles fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. The data were analysed using the Wilcoxon test. For 327 patients who underwent GPi-DBS, the preoperative baseline Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, off-medication, mean was 52.7 (range 26.5-77.2). The postoperative UPDRS score, off-medication/on-stimulation, mean was 33.7 (range 18.7-46.2). The delta mean (the difference in mean UPDRS score between baseline and maximum follow-up) was 19.1 (range -2.2 to 36.5) (p<0.001). When the electrical parameters were compared against the delta UPDRS score, the analysis showed that only frequency was correlated with motor improvement (R(2)=0.42, p<0.05). Thus, GPi-DBS is a highly effective target for neuromodulation in PD. However, we found that significant clinical improvement (>50% delta UPDRS score) in PD is achieved at an amplitude of between 2.0V and 3.5V, a pulse-width between 75 micros and 300 micros and a frequency between 100Hz and 190Hz.			2009				31
A systematic review on the effectiveness of willow bark for musculoskeletal pain		Vlachojannis, J. E., Cameron, M., Chrubasik, S. and Department of Orthodontics, Columbia University W. th V. C. Rm B. N. Y. C. N. Y. U. S. A. jec columbia edu				phytotherapy research	phytotherapy research	Since ancient times preparations from Salix species have been used to alleviate pain. The aim of this study was to update the evidence of the effectiveness of willow bark products in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain. OVID(MEDLINE), PUBMED, Silverplatter, and CENTRAL and manual searches were used to identify clinical trials investigating Salix preparations. Authors SC and JEV extracted the data independently and discussed disagreements. Seven manuscripts were identified, reporting four trials with confirmatory and four with exploratory study designs. Three manuscripts presented the same trial data: repetitious reports were excluded. One confirmatory and two exploratory studies indicate a dose-dependent analgesic effect not inferior to rofecoxib in patients with low back pain. In one exploratory and one confirmatory study conflicting results were achieved in participants with osteoarthritis. No significant effect was seen in a confirmatory study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but this study was grossly underpowered. All studies investigated ethanolic extracts with daily doses up to 240 mg salicin over periods of up to six weeks. Minor adverse events occurred during treatment. The review provides moderate evidence of effectiveness for the use of ethanolic willow bark extract in low back pain. Further studies are required to find out if treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis requires extract with higher doses than 240 mg salicin per day.			2009				859
Statins as anti-arrhythmics: a systematic review part II: effects on risk of ventricular arrhythmias		Abuissa, H., O'Keefe, J. H. and Bybee, K. A.				clinical cardiology	clinical cardiology	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that statins may possess anti-arrhythmic properties in addition to their lipid-lowering effects. METHODS: Studies which reported the association of statins with the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias were identified through a systematic review of the published literature. RESULTS: Statins have been associated with a significant reductions in ventricular arrhythmia in cardiomyopathy patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, although randomized trials have not been completed. CONCLUSIONS: Published data suggests that statins may possess anti-arrhythmic properties that reduce the propensity for ventricular arrhythmias. Most of this data is observational; more randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed.			2009				7
Genetic variants and normal tissue toxicity after radiotherapy: a systematic review		Andreassen, C. N. and Alsner, J.				radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the european society for therapeutic radiology and oncology	radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the european society for therapeutic radiology and oncology	During the last decade, nearly 60 studies have addressed possible associations between various genetic sequence alterations and risk of adverse reactions after radiotherapy. We report here an overview of these studies with information on the genetic variants, tumour type, number of patients included, the endpoint studied, the mechanism(s) by which the candidate genes are involved in the pathogenesis of normal tissue toxicity, and odds ratios (ORs) for candidate variants. Though many positive results have been reported, inconsistent findings and non-replication of previous results have frequently occurred. This can presumably be attributed to certain methodological shortcomings including lack of statistical power to detect small effect sizes. Based on theoretical considerations and experiences from other scientific fields, we discuss how future studies should be designed in order to successfully unravel the genetics of normal tissue radiosensitivity. We propose a model of the allelic architecture that may underlie differences in normal tissue radiosensitivity. Genome wide association studies have proven a powerful tool to identify novel loci that affect various phenotypes. Nonetheless, genome wide association studies are extremely demanding in terms of sample size. Furthermore, certain limitations still relate to this kind of studies, emphasizing the need for international consortia such as the ESTRO GENEPI.			2009				33
Catheter-directed therapy for the treatment of massive pulmonary embolism: systematic review and meta-analysis of modern techniques		Kuo, W. T., Gould, M. K., Louie, J. D., Rosenberg, J. K., Sze, D. Y. and Hofmann, L. V.				journal of vascular and interventional radiology : jvir	journal of vascular and interventional radiology : jvir	PURPOSE: Systemic thrombolysis for the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) carries an estimated 20% risk of major hemorrhage, including a 3%-5% risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The authors used evidence-based methods to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of modern catheter-directed therapy (CDT) as an alternative treatment for massive PE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The systematic review was initiated by electronic literature searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE) for studies published from January 1990 through September 2008. Inclusion criteria were applied to select patients with acute massive PE treated with modern CDT. Modern techniques were defined as the use of low-profile devices (< or =10 F), mechanical fragmentation and/or aspiration of emboli including rheolytic thrombectomy, and intraclot thrombolytic injection if a local drug was infused. Relevant non-English language articles were translated into English. Paired reviewers assessed study quality and abstracted data. Meta-analysis was performed by using random effects models to calculate pooled estimates for complications and clinical success rates across studies. Clinical success was defined as stabilization of hemodynamics, resolution of hypoxia, and survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-four patients from 35 studies (six prospective, 29 retrospective) met the criteria for inclusion. The pooled clinical success rate from CDT was 86.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.1%, 90.2%). Pooled risks of minor and major procedural complications were 7.9% (95% CI: 5.0%, 11.3%) and 2.4% (95% CI: 1.9%, 4.3%), respectively. Data on the use of systemic thrombolysis before CDT were available in 571 patients; 546 of those patients (95%) were treated with CDT as the first adjunct to heparin without previous intravenous thrombolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Modern CDT is a relatively safe and effective treatment for acute massive PE. At experienced centers, CDT should be considered as a first-line treatment for patients with massive PE.			2009				428
Topical steroids in chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Kalish, L. H., Arendts, G., Sacks, R. and Craig, J. C.				otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of american academy of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery	otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of american academy of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether topical steroids provide symptomatic relief in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of the articles identified by two independent reviewers of all randomized controlled trials that had evaluated intranasal corticosteroids in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without polyps. The quality of included studies was evaluated, and results synthesized using standard random-effects meta-analytical methods. RESULTS: Of 424 potential studies, only nine randomized trials involving 657 patients in total were eligible. Quality of design and reporting was suboptimal, with only one trial adhering to accepted standards for reporting. Five trials combined outcome measures and reported on overall response of CRS without polyps to topical steroids. The summary estimate for overall response to treatment showed no significant benefit and substantial variability among studies (5 trials: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50-1.10, P = 0.14, chi(2) = 13.78, I(2) = 66.2%). Total symptom score was reported in three trials with a standardized mean difference favoring topical steroids (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.16-1.09, P = 0.009), with no evidence of heterogeneity (chi(2) = 3.03, P = 0.22). Although the data were limited, there were no reports of increased adverse effects with topical steroids. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a clear overall benefit for topical steroids in CRS without polyps; however, their use appears safe and may show some symptomatic benefit. A class effect among different topical steroids cannot be assumed, and further trials are required.			2009				380
Antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis C in illicit drug users: a systematic review		Zanini, B. and Lanzini, A.				antiviral therapy	antiviral therapy	According to recent World Health Organization data, approximately 170-200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). At present, illicit drug users (IDUs) constitute the largest group of individuals infected with HCV in industrial countries. Between 50% and 90% of IDUs are estimated to be positive for anti-HCV antibodies and most of the new infections occur in IDUs. The aim of our review is to focus on tertiary prevention of HCV infection among IDUs. We review strategies to prevent HCV infection and disease progression, attitude to antiviral treatment, access to specific HCV therapy and data of efficacy and safety of antiviral treatment among IDUs.			2009				918
Strategies for rehabilitation professionals to move evidence-based knowledge into practice: a systematic review		Menon, A., Korner-Bitensky, N., Kastner, M., McKibbon, K. A. and Straus, S.				journal of rehabilitation medicine : official journal of the uems european board of physical and rehabilitation medicine	journal of rehabilitation medicine : official journal of the uems european board of physical and rehabilitation medicine	RATIONALE: Rehabilitation clinicians need to stay current regarding best practices, especially since adherence to clinical guidelines can significantly improve patient outcomes. However, little is known about the benefits of knowledge translation interventions for these professionals. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of single or multi-component knowledge translation interventions for improving knowledge, attitudes, and practice behaviors of rehabilitation clinicians. METHODS: Systematic review of 7 databases conducted to identify studies evaluating knowledge translation interventions specific to occupational therapists and physical therapists. RESULTS: 12 studies met the eligibility criteria. For physical therapists, participation in an active multi-component knowledge translation intervention resulted in improved evidence-based knowledge and practice behaviors compared with passive dissemination strategies. These gains did not translate into change in clinicians' attitudes towards best practices. For occupational therapists, no studies have examined the use of multi-component interventions; studies of single interventions suggest limited evidence of effectiveness for all outcomes measured. CONCLUSION: While this review suggests the use of active, multi-component knowledge translation interventions to enhance knowledge and practice behaviors of physical therapists, additional research is needed to understand the impact of these strategies on occupational therapists. Serious research gaps remain regarding which knowledge translation strategies impact positively on patient outcomes.			2009				542
The effects of eccentric versus concentric resistance training on muscle strength and mass in healthy adults: a systematic review with meta-analysis		Roig, M., O'Brien, K., Kirk, G., Murray, R., McKinnon, P., Shadgan, B. and Reid, W. D.				british journal of sports medicine	british journal of sports medicine	The aim of this systematic review was to determine if eccentric exercise is superior to concentric exercise in stimulating gains in muscle strength and mass. Meta-analyses were performed for comparisons between eccentric and concentric training as means to improve muscle strength and mass. In order to determine the importance of different parameters of training, subgroup analyses of intensity of exercise, velocity of movement and mode of contraction were also performed. Twenty randomised controlled trials studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses showed that when eccentric exercise was performed at higher intensities compared with concentric training, total strength and eccentric strength increased more significantly. However, compared with concentric training, strength gains after eccentric training appeared more specific in terms of velocity and mode of contraction. Eccentric training performed at high intensities was shown to be more effective in promoting increases in muscle mass measured as muscle girth. In addition, eccentric training also showed a trend towards increased muscle cross-sectional area measured with magnetic resonance imaging or computerised tomography. Subgroup analyses suggest that the superiority of eccentric training to increase muscle strength and mass appears to be related to the higher loads developed during eccentric contractions. The specialised neural pattern of eccentric actions possibly explains the high specificity of strength gains after eccentric training. Further research is required to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this specificity and its functional significance in terms of transferability of strength gains to more complex human movements.			2009				702
Intramedullary versus extramedullary fixation for subtrochanteric femur fractures		Kuzyk, P. R., Bhandari, M., McKee, M. D., Russell, T. A., Schemitsch, E. H. and Division of Orthopaedic Surgery, Department of Surgery St Michael's Hospital University of Toronto Toronto Ontario Canada				journal of orthopaedic trauma	journal of orthopaedic trauma	OBJECTIVES: Both intramedullary and extramedullary internal fixation has been advocated for the treatment of subtrochanteric femur fractures. Is there clinical evidence to recommend one method of internal fixation over the other? DATA SOURCES: A search of MEDLINE (1950 to June 2007), CINAHL (1982 to June 2007), and EMBASE (1980 to June 2007) was performed. Results were limited to English language studies. References from eligible studies were reviewed to identify additional studies. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected for review based on the following criteria: comparison and observational studies examining the use of intramedullary and/or extramedullary implants for the fixation of subtrochanteric femur fractures, inclusion of intertrochanteric hip fractures with subtrochanteric extension, exclusion of pure intertrochanteric and intracapsular hip fractures, and exclusion of pathologic fractures. DATA EXTRACTION: The following outcomes were extracted from eligible studies: operative time, operative blood loss, intraoperative complications, postoperative medical complications, number of patients transfused, wound complications, failure of fixation, rate of nonunion, length of hospital stay, and functional recovery. DATA SYNTHESIS: Three level I and 9 level IV studies were identified and used in the systematic review of outcomes for intramedullary and extramedullary fixation for subtrochanteric fractures. Three level I studies were used to calculate a pooled relative risk for failure of fixation with a 95% confidence interval. An analysis of heterogeneity between pooled studies was conducted. CONCLUSIONS: There is grade B evidence that operative time is reduced and that fixation failure is reduced with the use of intramedullary implants for subtrochanteric fractures. Future studies should perform subgroup analysis according to the type of population sampled (ie, young versus elderly) and subtrochanteric fracture type.			2009				431
Linking family planning with HIV/AIDS interventions: a systematic review of the evidence		Spaulding, A. B., Brickley, D. B., Kennedy, C., Almers, L., Packel, L., Mirjahangir, J., Kennedy, G., Collins, L., Osborne, K. and Mbizvo, M.				aids (london, england)	aids (london, england)	OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the literature and examine the effectiveness, optimal circumstances, and best practices for strengthening linkages between family planning and HIV interventions. DESIGN: Systematic review of peer-reviewed articles and unpublished program reports ('promising practices') evaluating interventions linking family planning and HIV services. METHODS: Articles were included if they reported post-intervention evaluation results from an intervention linking family planning and HIV services between 1990 and 2007. Systematic methods were used for searching, screening, and data extraction. Quality assessment was conducted using a 9-point rigor scale. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in the analysis (10 peer-reviewed studies and six promising practices). Interventions were categorized into six types: family planning services provided to HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) clients, family planning and VCT services provided to maternal and child health clients, family planning services provided to people living with HIV, community health workers provided family planning and HIV services, VCT provided to family planning clinic clients, and VCT and family planning services provided to women receiving postabortion care. Average study design rigor was low (3.25 out of 9). Most studies reported generally positive or mixed results for key outcomes; no negative results were reported. CONCLUSION: Interventions linking family planning and HIV services were generally considered feasible and effective, though overall evaluation rigor was low.			2009				774
Scalpel safety in the operative setting: a systematic review		Watt, A. M., Patkin, M., Sinnott, M. J., Black, R. J. and Maddern, G. J.				surgery	surgery	"BACKGROUND: The complex environment of the operative setting provides multiple opportunities for health care workers to sustain scalpel injuries; scalpels are the second most frequent source of sharps injuries in this setting. Little evidence has been published detailing the effectiveness of proposed safety procedures and devices. METHODS: A systematic search strategy was used to identify relevant studies. Studies were included based on the application of a predetermined protocol, an independent assessment by 2 reviewers, and a consensus decision. Nineteen articles formed the evidence base for this review. RESULTS: Little high-level evidence was available. The results of studies reporting on 5 different devices/procedures were identified: the use of cut-resistant gloves/liners decreased the number of glove perforations in comparison with double latex gloves alone but lessened the wearer's dexterity and tactile sensation; the benefit derived from the use of the hands-free passing technique seemed equivocal; ""sharpless surgery"" was found to be feasible; a single-handed blade remover prevented at least as many injuries as a safety scalpel; and some shoe materials provided superior foot protection. CONCLUSION: The lack of available evidence highlights the need for the generation of a methodologically rigorous, clinically relevant, and statistically valid body of primary research in this area to support appropriate and effective safety interventions."			2010				878
Management of stage I seminomatous testicular cancer: a systematic review		Chung, P., Mayhew, L. A., Warde, P., Winquist, E., Lukka, H. and Genitourinary Cancer Disease Site Group of Cancer Care Ontario's Program in Evidence-based, Care				clinical oncology (royal college of radiologists (great britain))	clinical oncology (royal college of radiologists (great britain))	The treatment options available for the management of stage I seminoma consist of either a surveillance strategy or adjuvant therapy after orchidectomy. A systematic review was undertaken to identify the optimal management strategy. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, in addition to the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting Proceedings, were searched for the period 1981 to May 2007. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they discussed at least one of survival, recurrence, second malignancy, cardiac toxicity, or quality of life for patients with stage I seminoma. A search update was carried out in June 2009. Fifty-four reports satisfied the eligibility criteria, including seven clinical practice guidelines, one systematic review, three randomised controlled trials focused on treatment options, 26 non-randomised studies of treatment options, and 15 non-randomised long-term toxicity studies. The existing data suggest that virtually all patients with stage I testicular seminoma are cured regardless of the post-orchidectomy management. The 5-year survival reported in all the studies identified in this systematic review was over 95%, regardless of the management strategy, including surveillance alone with no adjuvant therapy. In conclusion, to date, the optimal management of stage I seminoma remains to be defined. Surveillance seems to be the preferable option, as this strategy minimises the toxicity that might be associated with adjuvant treatment, while preserving high long-term cure rates. The currently available evidence should be presented to patients in order to select the most appropriate option for the individual.			2010				147
The role of prophylactic anticonvulsants in the management of brain metastases: a systematic review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline		Mikkelsen, T., Paleologos, N. A., Robinson, P. D., Ammirati, M., Andrews, D. W., Asher, A. L., Burri, S. H., Cobbs, C. S., Gaspar, L. E., Kondziolka, D., Linskey, M. E., Loeffler, J. S., McDermott, M., Mehta, M. P., Olson, J. J., Patchell, R. A., Ryken, T. C. and Kalkanis, S. N.				journal of neuro-oncology	journal of neuro-oncology	QUESTION: Do prophylactic anticonvulsants decrease the risk of seizure in patients with metastatic brain tumors compared with no treatment? TARGET POPULATION: These recommendations apply to adults with solid brain metastases who have not experienced a seizure due to their metastatic brain disease. RECOMMENDATION: Level 3 For adults with brain metastases who have not experienced a seizure due to their metastatic brain disease, routine prophylactic use of anticonvulsants is not recommended. Only a single underpowered randomized controlled trial (RCT), which did not detect a difference in seizure occurrence, provides evidence for decision-making purposes.			2010				551
Effects of the pharmaceutical technologic aspects of oral pediatric drugs on patient-related outcomes: a systematic literature review		van Riet-Nales, D. A., Schobben, A. F., Egberts, T. C. and Rademaker, C. M.				clinical therapeutics	clinical therapeutics	Background: In view of the high rates of off-label and unlicensed prescribing of drugs in children, the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Union have implemented legislative regulations for the pharmaceutical industry to increase the number of drugs with approved pediatric labeling. However, the extent to which the effects of pharmaceutical technologic aspects of pediatric oral drugs (eg, taste, route and frequency of administration, user instructions) on patient-related outcomes (eg, efficacy, tolerability, preference, adherence) can be based on clinical evidence from the available literature is unknown. Objective: This systematic literature review aimed to identify the nature, volume, and quality of comparative studies that have assessed the effects of pharmaceutical technologic aspects of oral pediatric drugs on patient-related outcomes. Methods: The Cochrane, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases were searched from their start through December 31, 2009. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were published in English; included search terms for child, study design, medicine, formulation aspects, dosage form, routes of administration, patient acceptance, adherence, side effects and tolerability, and/or efficacy; reported on >/=10 children aged 0 to <18 years; and described the effects of >/=1 of 3 pharmaceutical technologic aspects of an oral pediatric drug (formulation and dosage form; route and frequency of administration; and/or packaging, administration device, and user instruction) on >/=1 of 6 patient-related outcomes (clinical efficacy, side effects and tolerability, patient preference, patient acceptance, administration errors, and/or adherence). Studies were excluded if they concerned a nonallopathic drug (ie, homeopathic remedy, anthroposophic drug, herbal supplement, or food supplement); related to asthma (because modern asthma treatment protocols strongly favor the use of drug inhalation above oral medication); and/or related to analgesics. The characteristics of each of the included publications were assessed with respect to pharmaceutical technologic aspect studied; patient-related outcomes studied; pharmacotherapeutic indication; year of publication; geographic location; number and age of the included subjects; and sponsorship by industry and/or author affiliation with the pharmaceutical industry. The electronic search was supplemented with a manual search of the cited references. Results: Ninety-four publications were identified as eligible for inclusion. These publications reported on 176 assessments of the effects of >/=1 pharmaceutical technologic aspect on >/=1 patient-related outcome. Fiftyfive percent of the studies were conducted in children aged 2 or 3 years, and 69% in children aged 4 or 5 years. Forty-three percent of the publications included >/=100 patients. Fifty-one percent of the studies were conducted in the United States or Canada, and 29% in Europe. Antibacterials for systemic use were the subject of 30% of the included publications. Two of the 94 publications were of appropriate méthodologie quality (Jadad score >/=4). Forty-nine percent of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry or were written by >/=1 author affiliated with the industry. Sixty-eight percent of the included studies had Jadad scores of 0 or 1 (poor quality). The proportion of industry-sponsored or industry-authored studies with a Jadad score >/=2 or in >/=100 children was not significantly different from that of non-industry-sponsored or-authored studies. The proportion of industry-sponsored or industry-authored studies conducted in the United States/Canada (48 [51%]) was not significantly different from that of studies conducted elsewhere (46 [49%]). The distribution of technologic aspects assessed in the included studies were formulation and dosage form, 48%; route and frequency of administration, 44%; and packaging, administration device, and user instruction, 8%. Seventy-six assessments included >/=100 patients. Twenty-one of these assessments addressed patient acceptance or pat ent preference; 17, clinical efficacy; and 14, side effects and tolerability. Conclusions: This systematic review identified 94 articles on oral drugs for use in children and adolescents, which reported on a total 176 assessments of the effects of 3 pharmaceutical technologic aspects (formulation and dosage form; route and frequency of administration; and packaging, administration device, and user instruction) on 6 patient-related outcomes (clinical efficacy, side effects and tolerability, patient preference, patient acceptance, administration errors, and adherence). Only 2 of the 94 publications were of appropriate methodologic quality. These results suggest that published clinical evidence to support pharmaceutical development programs is limited.			2010				847
Vaginal birth after two caesarean sections (VBAC-2)-a systematic review with meta-analysis of success rate and adverse outcomes of VBAC-2 versus VBAC-1 and repeat (third) caesarean sections		Tahseen, S. and Griffiths, M.				bjog : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology	bjog : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology	BACKGROUND: Trial of vaginal birth after Caesarean (VBAC) is considered acceptable after one caesarean section (CS), however, women wishing to have trial after two CS are generally not allowed or counselled appropriately of efficacy and complications. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of literature on success rate of vaginal birth after two caesarean sections (VBAC-2) and associated adverse maternal and fetal outcomes; and compare with commonly accepted VBAC-1 and the alternative option of repeat third CS (RCS). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Current Controlled Trials, HMIC Database, Grey Literature Databases (SIGLE, Biomed Central), using search terms Caesarean section, caesarian, C*rean, C*rian, and MeSH headings 'Vaginal birth after caesarean section', combined with second search string two, twice, second, multiple. SELECTION CRITERIA: No randomised studies were available, case series or cohort studies were assessed for quality (STROBE), 20/23 available studies included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers selected studies and abstracted and tabulated data and pooled estimates were obtained on success rate, uterine rupture and other adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan-5 to compare VBAC-1 versus VBAC-2 and VBAC-2 versus RCS. MAIN RESULTS: VBAC-2 success rate was 71.1%, uterine rupture rate 1.36%, hysterectomy rate 0.55%, blood transfusion 2.01%, neonatal unit admission rate 7.78% and perinatal asphyxial injury/death 0.09%. VBAC-2 versus VBAC-1 success rates were 4064/5666 (71.1%) versus 38 814/50 685 (76.5%) (P < 0.001); associated uterine rupture rate 1.59% versus 0.72% (P < 0.001) and hysterectomy rates were 0.56% versus 0.19% (P = 0.001) respectively. Comparing VBAC-2 versus RCS, the hysterectomy rates were 0.40% versus 0.63% (P = 0.63), transfusion 1.68% versus 1.67% (P = 0.86) and febrile morbidity 6.03% versus 6.39%, respectively (P = 0.27). Maternal morbidity of VBAC-2 was comparable to RCS. Neonatal morbidity data were too limited to draw valid conclusions, however, no significant differences were indicated in VBAC-2, VBAC-1 and RCS groups in NNU admission rates and asphyxial injury/neonatal death rates (Mantel-Haenszel). CONCLUSIONS: Women requesting for a trial of vaginal delivery after two caesarean sections should be counselled appropriately considering available data of success rate 71.1%, uterine rupture rate 1.36% and of a comparative maternal morbidity with repeat CS option.			2010				797
Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: systematic review of clinical risk markers		Christiaans, I., van Engelen, K., van Langen, I. M., Birnie, E., Bonsel, G. J., Elliott, P. M. and Wilde, A. A.				europace : european pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the european society of cardiology	europace : european pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the european society of cardiology	We performed a systematic literature review of recommended 'major' and 'possible' clinical risk markers for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We searched the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases for articles published between 1971 and 2007. We included English language reports on HCM patients containing follow-up data on the endpoint (sudden) cardiac death using survival analysis. Analysis was undertaken using the quality of reporting of meta-analyses (QUORUM) statement checklist. The quality was checked using a quality assessment form from the Cochrane Collaboration. Thirty studies met inclusion criteria and passed quality assessment. The use of the six major risk factors (previous cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, extreme left ventricular hypertrophy, unexplained syncope, abnormal blood pressure response, and family history of sudden death) in risk stratification for SCD as recommended by international guidelines was supported by the literature. In addition, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction seems associated with a higher risk of SCD. Our systematic review provides sound evidence for the use of the six major risk factors for SCD in the risk stratification of HCM patients. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction could be included in the overall risk profile of patients with a marked left ventricular outflow gradient under basal conditions.			2010				144
Systematic review of the clinical effectiveness of Genotropin (somatropin) in children with short stature		Loftus, J., Heatley, R., Walsh, C. and Dimitri, P.				journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : jpem	journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : jpem	Genotropin (somatropin) is licensed for the treatment of children with growth hormone deficiency, Prader-Willi syndrome, Turner syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency and in children born small for gestational age. This systematic review (SR) evaluated the clinical efficacy and effectiveness of Genotropin in these conditions to inform a NICE Technology Appraisal of growth hormone for the treatment of growth failure in children. Search terms were used to search seven databases, including Medline and Embase, for English language studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies investigating Genotropin in children were included. Out of 30 RCTs identified, one reported final height data. Eleven observational studies reported final height and seven were based on the Pfizer International Growth Survey (KIGS). This SR highlights the lack of long-term RCTs reporting final height data and other important qualitative outcomes, such as quality of life. Observational data, such as those from KIGS, remain vital for informing therapy.			2010				474
Systematic review and meta-analysis of Saccharomyces boulardii in adult patients		McFarland, L. V.				world journal of gastroenterology : wjg	world journal of gastroenterology : wjg	This article reviews the evidence for efficacy and safety of Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) for various disease indications in adults based on the peer-reviewed, randomized clinical trials and pre-clinical studies from the published medical literature (Medline, Clinical Trial websites and meeting abstracts) between 1976 and 2009. For meta-analysis, only randomized, blinded controlled trials unrestricted by language were included. Pre-clinical studies, volunteer studies and uncontrolled studies were excluded from the review of efficacy and meta-analysis, but included in the systematic review. Of 31 randomized, placebo-controlled treatment arms in 27 trials (encompassing 5029 study patients), S. boulardii was found to be significantly efficacious and safe in 84% of those treatment arms. A meta-analysis found a significant therapeutic efficacy for S. boulardii in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) (RR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.35-0.63, P < 0.001). In adults, S. boulardii can be strongly recommended for the prevention of AAD and the traveler's diarrhea. Randomized trials also support the use of this yeast probiotic for prevention of enteral nutrition-related diarrhea and reduction of Helicobacter pylori treatment-related symptoms. S. boulardii shows promise for the prevention of C. difficile disease recurrences; treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, acute adult diarrhea, Crohn's disease, giardiasis, human immunodeficiency virus-related diarrhea; but more supporting evidence is recommended for these indications. The use of S. boulardii as a therapeutic probiotic is evidence-based for both efficacy and safety for several types of diarrhea.			2010				535
New-onset diabetes and antihypertensive treatment		Grimm, C., Köberlein, J., Wiosna, W., Kresimon, J., Kiencke, P. and Rychlik, R.				gms health technology assessment	gms health technology assessment	INTRODUCTION: Chronic diseases substantially contribute to the continuous increase in health care expenditures, including type-2 diabetes mellitus as one of the most expensive chronic diseases. Arterial hypertension presents a risk factor for the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus. Numerous analyses have demonstrated that antihypertensive therapies promote the development of type-2-diabetes mellitus. Studies indicate, that the application of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor-blockers (ARB) lead to less new-onset diabetes compared to beta-blockers, diuretics and placebo. Given that beta-blockers and diuretics impair the glucose metabolism, the metabolic effects of different antihypertensive drugs should be regarded; otherwise not only the disease itself, but also antihypertensive therapies may promote the development of new-onset diabetes. Even though, the cost of ACE inhibitors and ARB are higher, the use in patients with metabolic disorders could be cost-effective in the long-term if new-onset diabetes is avoided. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate which class of antihypertensive agents promote the development or the manifestation of type-2 diabetes mellitus. How high is the incidence of new-onset diabetes during antihypertensive therapy and how is treatment-induced type-2 diabetes mellitus evaluated clinically? Which agents are therefore cost-effective in the long term? Which ethical, social or legal aspects should be regarded? METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted including clinical trials with at least ten participants which reported new-onset diabetes in the course of antihypertensive treatment. The trials had to be published after 1966 (after 2003 for economic publications) in English or German. RESULTS: A total of 34 clinical publications meet the inclusion criteria. Of these, eight publications focus on the development of diabetes mellitus under treatment with diuretic and/or beta-blockers, six publications focused on ACE inhibitors alone or in combination with calcium-channel-blockers, ten publications on ARB and/or ACE inhibitors with respect to their effects on new-onset diabetes or their preventive aspects. Furthermore, five publications investigate the role of calcium-channel-antagonists in the development of diabetes, and five publications indicate the development of new-onset diabetes with different antihypertensive agents amongst each other or in comparison to no antihypertensive treatment. The clinical trials show a significant difference in the development of new-onset diabetes. Therapies with diuretics and/or beta-blockers result in a higher incidence of new-onset diabetes. ARB as well as ACE inhibitors have a preventive effect and calcium-channel-blockers show a neutral position regarding the development of new-onset diabetes. Two publications report on economic results. The first one evaluates the cost-effectiveness of ARB alone or in combination with calcium-channel-blockers in comparison to diuretics alone or in combination with beta-blockers. The second publication compares economic outcomes of calcium-channel-blockers and beta-blockers considering the development of new-onset diabetes. Treatment with the ARB candesartan lead to savings in total costs of 549 US-Dollar per patient and in incremental costs of 30,000 US-Dollar per diabetes mellitus avoided. In the second publication, costs to the amount of 18,965 Euro in Great Britain and 13,210 Euro in Sweden are quoted for an avoided event. The treatment with calcium-channel-blockers compared to beta-blockers is proven to be more cost-effective. No publications were identified regarding ethical, social and legal aspects. DISCUSSION: The available meta-analyses allow for a high clinical evidence level. A few studies vary in terms of diabetes definition and study duration. In most of the trials, the incidence of new-onset diabetes is not an endpoint. The evaluation of treatment-induced diabetes mellitus cannot be conducted, due to the lack of sufficient results in the identified literature. The tw economic studies do not address all the objectives sufficiently. Ethical, social and legal aspects are discussed but not analysed systematically. CONCLUSION: Based on these studies, sufficient evidence to confirm the presumption that diuretics and/or beta-blockers promote the development of new-onset diabetes compared to other antihypertensive agents, especially in patients who are predisposed, is presented with this report. Trials reflecting the clinical relevance of treatment-induced diabetes mellitus compared to existing diabetes mellitus regarding cardiovascular outcomes are required. Also health economic evaluations considering the development of new-onset diabetes should be conducted for the different classes of antihypertensive agents.			2010				290
Extracorporeal lung support technologies - bridge to recovery and bridge to lung transplantation in adult patients: an evidence-based analysis		Health Quality, Ontario				ontario health technology assessment series	ontario health technology assessment series	UNLABELLED: For cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and progressive chronic respiratory failure, the first choice or treatment is mechanical ventilation. For decades, this method has been used to support critically ill patients in respiratory failure. Despite its life-saving potential, however, several experimental and clinical studies have suggested that ventilator-induced lung injury can adversely affect the lungs and patient outcomes. Current opinion is that by reducing the pressure and volume of gas delivered to the lungs during mechanical ventilation, the stress applied to the lungs is eased, enabling them to rest and recover. In addition, mechanical ventilation may fail to provide adequate gas exchange, thus patients may suffer from severe hypoxia and hypercapnea. For these reasons, extracorporeal lung support technologies may play an important role in the clinical management of patients with lung failure, allowing not only the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) but also buying the lungs the time needed to rest and heal. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to assess the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal lung support technologies in the improvement of pulmonary gas exchange and the survival of adult patients with acute pulmonary failure and those with end-stage chronic progressive lung disease as a bridge to lung transplantation (LTx). The application of these technologies in primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after LTx is beyond the scope of this review and is not discussed. CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF EXTRACORPOREAL LUNG SUPPORT: Extracorporeal lung support technologies [i.e., Interventional Lung Assist (ILA) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)] have been advocated for use in the treatment of patients with respiratory failure. These techniques do not treat the underlying lung condition; rather, they improve gas exchange while enabling the implantation of a protective ventilation strategy to prevent further damage to the lung tissues imposed by the ventilator. As such, extracorporeal lung support technologies have been used in three major lung failure case types: As a bridge to recovery in acute lung failure - for patients with injured or diseased lungs to give their lungs time to heal and regain normal physiologic function.As a bridge to LTx - for patients with irreversible end stage lung disease requiring LTx.As a bridge to recovery after LTx - used as lung support for patients with PGD or severe hypoxemia. EX-VIVO LUNG PERFUSION AND ASSESSMENT: Recently, the evaluation and reconditioning of donor lungs ex-vivo has been introduced into clinical practice as a method of improving the rate of donor lung utilization. Generally, about 15% to 20% of donor lungs are suitable for LTx, but these figures may increase with the use of ex-vivo lung perfusion. The ex-vivo evaluation and reconditioning of donor lungs is currently performed at the Toronto General Hospital (TGH) and preliminary results have been encouraging (Personal communication, clinical expert, December 17, 2009). If its effectiveness is confirmed, the use of the technique could lead to further expansion of donor organ pools and improvements in post-LTx outcomes. EXTRACORPOREAL LUNG SUPPORT TECHNOLOGIES: ECMO: The ECMO system consists of a centrifugal pump, a membrane oxygenator, inlet and outlet cannulas, and tubing. The exchange of oxygen and CO(2) then takes place in the oxygenator, which delivers the reoxygenated blood back into one of the patient's veins or arteries. Additional ports may be added for haemodialysis or ultrafiltration. TWO DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES MAY BE USED TO INTRODUCE ECMO: venoarterial and venovenous. In the venoarterial technique, cannulation is through either the femoral artery and the femoral vein, or through the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein. In the venovenous technique cannulation is through both femoral veins or a femoral vein and internal jugular vein; one cannula acts as inflow or arterial line, and the other as an outflow or venous line. enovenous ECMO will not provide adequate support if a patient has pulmonary hypertension or right heart failure. Problems associated with cannulation during the procedure include bleeding around the cannulation site and limb ischemia distal to the cannulation site. ILA: Interventional Lung Assist (ILA) is used to remove excess CO(2) from the blood of patients in respiratory failure. The system is characterized by a novel, low-resistance gas exchange device with a diffusion membrane composed of polymethylpentene (PMP) fibres. These fibres are woven into a complex configuration that maximizes the exchange of oxygen and CO(2) by simple diffusion. The system is also designed to operate without the help of an external pump, though one can be added if higher blood flow is required. The device is then applied across an arteriovenous shunt between the femoral artery and femoral vein. Depending on the size of the arterial cannula used and the mean systemic arterial pressure, a blood flow of up to 2.5 L/min can be achieved (up to 5.5 L/min with an external pump). The cannulation is performed after intravenous administration of heparin. Recently, the first commercially available extracorporeal membrane ventilator (NovaLung GmbH, Hechingen, Germany) was approved for clinical use by Health Canada for patients in respiratory failure. The system has been used in more than 2,000 patients with various indications in Europe, and was used for the first time in North America at the Toronto General Hospital in 2006. EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: The research questions addressed in this report are: Does ILA/ECMO facilitate gas exchange in the lungs of patients with severe respiratory failure?Does ILA/ECMO improve the survival rate of patients with respiratory failure caused by a range of underlying conditions including patients awaiting LTx?What are the possible serious adverse events associated with ILA/ECMO therapy?To address these questions, a systematic literature search was performed on September 28, 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 2005 to September 28, 2008. Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with an unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist and then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies in which ILA/ECMO was used as a bridge to recovery or bridge to LTxStudies containing information relevant to the effectiveness and safety of the procedureStudies including at least five patients EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies reporting the use of ILA/ECMO for inter-hospital transfers of critically ill patientsStudies reporting the use of ILA/ECMO in patients during or after LTxAnimal or laboratory studiesCase reports OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Reduction in partial pressure of CO(2)Correction of respiratory acidosisImprovement in partial pressure of oxygenImprovement in patient survivalFrequency and severity of adverse eventsThe search yielded 107 citations in Medline and 107 citations in EMBASE. After reviewing the information provided in the titles and abstracts, eight citations were found to meet the study inclusion criteria. One study was then excluded because of an overlap in the study population with a previous study. Reference checking did not produce any additional studies for inclusion. Seven case series studies, all conducted in Germany, were thus included in this review (see Table 1). Also included is the recently published CESAR trial, a multicentre RCT in the UK in which ECMO was compared with conventional intensive care management. The results of the CESAR trial were published when this review was initiated. In th absence of any other recent RCT on ECMO, the results of this trial were considered for this assessment and no further searches were conducted. A literature search was then conducted for application of ECMO as bridge to LTx patients (January, 1, 2005 to current). A total of 127 citations on this topic were identified and reviewed but none were found to have examined the use of ECMO as bridge to LTx. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: To grade the quality of evidence, the grading system formulated by the GRADE working group and adopted by MAS was applied. The GRADE system classifies the quality of a body of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low according to four key elements: study design, study quality, consistency across studies, and directness. RESULTS: TRIALS ON ILA: Of the seven studies identified, six involved patients with ARDS caused by a range of underlying conditions; the seventh included only patients awaiting LTx. All studies reported the rate of gas exchange and respiratory mechanics before ILA and for up to 7 days of ILA therapy. Four studies reported the means and standard deviations of blood gas transfer and arterial blood pH, which were used for meta-analysis. Fischer et al. reported their first experience on the use of ILA as a bridge to LTx. In their study, 12 patients at high urgency status for LTx, who also had severe ventilation refractory hypercapnea and respiratory acidosis, were connected to ILA prior to LTx. Seven patients had a systemic infection or sepsis prior to ILA insertion. Six hours after initiation of ILA, the partial pressure of CO(2) in arterial blood significantly decreased (P < .05) and arterial blood pH significantly improved (P < .05) and remained stable for one week (last time point reported).

Point-of-decision prompts to increase stair use. A systematic review update		Soler, R. E., Leeks, K. D., Buchanan, L. R., Brownson, R. C., Heath, G. W., Hopkins, D. H. and Task Force on Community Preventive, Services				american journal of preventive medicine	american journal of preventive medicine	In 2000, the Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide) completed a systematic review of the effectiveness of various approaches to increasing physical activity including informational, behavioral and social, and environmental and policy approaches. Among these approaches was the use of signs placed by elevators and escalators to encourage stair use. This approach was found to be effective based on sufficient evidence. Over the past 5 years the body of evidence of this intervention has increased substantially, warranting an updated review. This update was conducted on 16 peer-reviewed studies (including the six studies in the previous systematic review), which met specified quality criteria and included evaluation outcomes of interest. These studies evaluated two interventions: point-of-decision prompts to increase stair use and enhancements to stairs or stairwells (e.g., painting walls, laying carpet, adding artwork, playing music) when combined with point-of-decision prompts to increase stair use. This latter intervention was not included in the original systematic review. According to the Community Guide rules of evidence, there is strong evidence that point-of-decision prompts are effective in increasing the use of stairs. There is insufficient evidence, due to an inadequate number of studies, to determine whether or not enhancements to stairs or stairwells are an effective addition to point-of-decision prompts. This article describes the rationale for these systematic reviews, along with information about the review process and the resulting conclusions. Additional information about applicability, other effects, and barriers to implementation is also provided.			2010				772
Anticoagulation risk in spine surgery		Cheng, J. S., Arnold, P. M., Anderson, P. A., Fischer, D. and Dettori, J. R.				spine	spine	STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To determine the high-risk populations for thromboembolic events in spine surgery patients, the risk of anticoagulation in spine surgery patients by type of anticoagulation, and whether there is a safe perioperative window of nonanticoagulation for these high-risk patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Thromboembolic complications after major spinal surgery is a significant risk for patients. Anticoagulation to reduce this risk is of concern because of the possibility of excessive bleeding or postoperative hematomas and associated neurologic deficits. There seems to be a paucity of literature on this topic. METHODS: A systematic review of the English-language literature was undertaken for articles published between January 1990 and December 2008. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify published studies examining coagulopathy in major spine surgery. Two independent reviewers assessed the strength of literature using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria, assessing quality, quantity, and consistency of results. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: A total of 93 articles were initially screened, and 29 ultimately met the predetermined inclusion criteria. The risk of thromboembolism in patients not receiving chemical prophylaxis was slightly higher in surgery to correct deformity (5.3%) and trauma patients (6.0%) than in surgery for degenerative conditions (2.3%). Fatal pulmonary embolism was rare. Bleeding complications occurred rarely with the use of anticoagulation; risk of major bleeding ranged from 0.0% to 4.3% across several types of anticoagulants. Postoperative hematoma was reported in only 10 of 2507 patients. CONCLUSION: Venous thromboembolism is uncommon after elective spine surgery. Trauma patients are at increased risk, and chemical prophylaxis should be considered. The safe timing of the administration of anticoagulation agents is unknown.			2010				133
Fosfomycin for the treatment of multidrug-resistant, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing, Enterobacteriaceae infections: a systematic review		Falagas, M. E., Kastoris, A. C., Kapaskelis, A. M. and Karageorgopoulos, D. E.				the lancet infectious diseases	the lancet infectious diseases	Rising rates of resistance to antimicrobial drugs among Enterobacteriaceae limit the choice of reliably active forms of these drugs. We evaluated the evidence on fosfomycin as a treatment option for infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with advanced resistance to antimicrobial drugs, including producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). We systematically reviewed studies evaluating the antimicrobial activity, or the clinical effectiveness of fosfomycin. 17 antimicrobial-susceptibility studies were found and included in our Review, accounting for 5057 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae with advanced resistance to antimicrobial drugs (4448 were producers of ESBL); 11 of the 17 studies reported that at least 90% of the isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. Using a provisional minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility breakpoint of 64 mg/L or less, 1604 (96.8%) of 1657 Escherichia coli isolates producing ESBL were susceptible to fosfomycin. Similarly, 608 (81.3%) of 748 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing ESBL were susceptible to fosfomycin. In two clinical studies, oral treatment with fosfomycin-trometamol was clinically effective against complicated or uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-producing E coli in, cumulatively, 75 (93.8%) of the 80 patients evaluated. Initial clinical data support the use of fosfomycin for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by these pathogens, although further research is needed.			2010				223
Effects of treatment in women with gestational diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis		Horvath, K., Koch, K., Jeitler, K., Matyas, E., Bender, R., Bastian, H., Lange, S. and Siebenhofer, A.				bmj (clinical research ed.)	bmj (clinical research ed.)	"OBJECTIVE: To summarise the benefits and harms of treatments for women with gestational diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, AMED, BIOSIS, CCMed, CDMS, CDSR, CENTRAL, CINAHL, DARE, HTA, NHS EED, Heclinet, SciSearch, several publishers' databases, and reference lists of relevant secondary literature up to October 2009. Review methods Included studies were randomised controlled trials of specific treatment for gestational diabetes compared with usual care or ""intensified"" compared with ""less intensified"" specific treatment. RESULTS: Five randomised controlled trials matched the inclusion criteria for specific versus usual treatment. All studies used a two step approach with a 50 g glucose challenge test or screening for risk factors, or both, and a subsequent 75 g or 100 g oral glucose tolerance test. Meta-analyses did not show significant differences for most single end points judged to be of direct clinical importance. In women specifically treated for gestational diabetes, shoulder dystocia was significantly less common (odds ratio 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.75), and one randomised controlled trial reported a significant reduction of pre-eclampsia (2.5 v 5.5%, P=0.02). For the surrogate end point of large for gestational age infants, the odds ratio was 0.48 (0.38 to 0.62). In the 13 randomised controlled trials of different intensities of specific treatments, meta-analysis showed a significant reduction of shoulder dystocia in women with more intensive treatment (0.31, 0.14 to 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for gestational diabetes, consisting of treatment to lower blood glucose concentration alone or with special obstetric care, seems to lower the risk for some perinatal complications. Decisions regarding treatment should take into account that the evidence of benefit is derived from trials for which women were selected with a two step strategy (glucose challenge test/screening for risk factors and oral glucose tolerance test)."			2010				331
Loco-regional treatment in metastatic breast cancer patients: is there a survival benefit?		Ly, B. H., Nguyen, N. P., Vinh-Hung, V., Rapiti, E. and Vlastos, G.				breast cancer research and treatment	breast cancer research and treatment	A number of studies have recently demonstrated a survival benefit in stage IV breast cancer patients following surgical resection of the primary tumor. Here, we investigate the relationship between loco-regional treatment and survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer and evaluate the impact of different loco-regional treatments. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed to analyze studies with the following criteria: Type of loco-regional treatment (surgery alone or combined with radiation, radiotherapy), overall survival, progression-free survival, selection factors for local treatment, and complication rates. Thirteen studies evaluated the effect of loco-regional treatment on overall survival with overall median survival increasing from a range of 12.6-28.3 months among patients without surgery to a range of 25-42 months among patients with surgery. In addition, six studies reported a 3-year survival benefit of 28-95% and 17-79% in women with and without locoregional therapy respectively. Two studies did not find any improvement in overall survival. One study found an improvement in 5-year breast cancer-specific survival of 27% with negative surgical margins versus 12% with no surgery. Three studies reported an advantage in progression-free survival in the treatment group compared with the non-treatment group. Loco-regional treatment for breast cancer patients with distant metastases at diagnosis is an important issue because of possible improvement of survival or disease-free survival. The possibility of surgery and/or radiotherapy following induction chemotherapy should be weighed and left to individual practice. Participation in randomized controlled trials should be encouraged.			2010				488
Evidence for treating rheumatoid arthritis to target: results of a systematic literature search		Schoels, M., Knevel, R., Aletaha, D., Bijlsma, J. W., Breedveld, F. C., Boumpas, D. T., Burmester, G., Combe, B., Cutolo, M., Dougados, M., Emery, P., van der Heijde, D., Huizinga, T. W., Kalden, J., Keystone, E. C., Kvien, T. K., Martin-Mola, E., Montecucco, C., de Wit, M. and Smolen, J. S.				annals of the rheumatic diseases	annals of the rheumatic diseases	OBJECTIVES: To summarise existing evidence on a target oriented approach for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search including all clinical trials testing clinical, functional, or structural values of a targeted treatment approach. Our search covered Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases until December 2008 and also conference abstracts (2007, 2008). RESULTS: The primary search yielded 5881 citations; after the selection process, 76 papers underwent detailed review. Of these, only seven strategic clinical trials were extracted: four studies randomised patients to routine or targeted treatment, two compared two different randomised targets and one compared targeted treatment to a historical control group. Five trials dealt with early RA patients. All identified studies showed significantly better clinical outcomes of targeted approaches than routine approaches. Disability was reported in two studies with no difference between groups. Four studies compared radiographic outcomes, two showing significant benefit of the targeted approach. CONCLUSION: Only few studies employed randomised controlled settings to test the value of treatment to a specific target. However, they provided unanimous evidence for benefits of targeted approaches. Nevertheless, more data on radiographic and functional outcomes and on patients with established RA are needed.			2010				729
Economic evaluation of capecitabine as adjuvant or metastatic therapy in colorectal cancer		Best, J. H. and Garrison, L. P.				expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research	expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research	Capecitabine, an oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, is indicated for adjuvant treatment in patients with Dukes' C colon cancer and for subsequent lines in metastatic colorectal cancer. The aim of this article is to review the literature on the economics of capecitabine for the treatment of colon cancer. A systematic review was conducted to search for articles published from January 2003 to December 2009 that met the inclusion criteria. For abstracts that were considered acceptable, full-text articles were then reviewed. Of the 42 potential studies that were identified, 13 original studies (16 publications) met the inclusion criteria. To date, the economic evaluation literature has consistently projected or found that capecitabine is not only a cost-effective treatment for adjuvant or for metastatic colorectal cancer (i.e., providing good value for money) but, furthermore, would actually be cost saving in the majority of country settings.			2010				71
Uterine artery embolization for fibroids is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage		Homer, H. and Saridogan, E.				fertility and sterility	fertility and sterility	OBJECTIVE: To investigate how uterine artery embolization (UAE) might alter the risk profile for pregnancies complicated by fibroids. DESIGN: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of existing studies. SETTING: Academic reproductive medicine unit. PATIENT(S): Women with fibroids. INTERVENTION(S): A systematic literature review, raw data extraction, and data analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rates of miscarriage, preterm delivery, malpresentation, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), cesarean delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). RESULT(S): Two hundred twenty-seven completed pregnancies after UAE were identified. Miscarriage rates were higher in UAE pregnancies (35.2%) compared with fibroid-containing pregnancies matched for age and fibroid location (16.5%) (odds ratio [OR] 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-3.8). The UAE pregnancies were more likely to be delivered by cesarean section (66% vs. 48.5%; OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.4-2.9) and to experience PPH (13.9% vs. 2.5%; OR 6.4; 95% CI 3.5-11.7). Rates of preterm delivery (14% vs. 16%; OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.5-1.5), IUGR (7.3% vs. 11.7%; OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.3-1.3), and malpresentation (10.4% vs. 13%; OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.4-1.5) were similar in UAE pregnancies and in control pregnancies with fibroids. CONCLUSION(S): The risk of miscarriage seems to be increased after UAE. In contrast, apart from an increased risk of abdominal delivery and PPH, critical adverse obstetric sequelae of IUGR and prematurity appear no more likely after UAE.			2010				327
Radiation effects on bone healing and reconstruction: interpretation of the literature		Jegoux, F., Malard, O., Goyenvalle, E., Aguado, E. and Daculsi, G.				oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology, oral radiology, and endodontics	oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology, oral radiology, and endodontics	OBJECTIVE: Reconstructing irradiated mandibles with biomaterials is still a challenge but little investigated. We collected data that could help us understand studies in the field of regeneration with biomaterials and irradiated bone. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature. RESULTS: Delay and duration of radiation delivery and total equivalent dose are the most variable parameters in the various studies, resulting in confusion when interpreting the literature. Most reproducible experiments show that radiation reduces osteogenic cell numbers, alters cytokine capacity, and delays and damages bone remodeling. Interindividual variations and how such changes become irreversible lesions are still uncertain. In the case of regeneration using biomaterials, most studies have addressed the question of reconstruction in previously irradiated bone. The results show that osseointegration is often possible, although the failure rate is higher. The sooner the implantation takes place after the end of the radiation, the higher the likelihood of failure. Few studies have focused on primary reconstruction followed by early irradiation, and most of the currently available engineering models would be altered by radiation. Good outcomes have been obtained with bone morphogenetic protein and with total bone marrow transplanation. CONCLUSION: This review points out the difficulties in achieving reproducible experiments and interpreting literature in this underinvestigated field.			2010				368
Abatacept for rheumatoid arthritis: a Cochrane systematic review		Maxwell, L. J. and Singh, J. A.				the journal of rheumatology	the journal of rheumatology	OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of efficacy and safety of abatacept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ACP Journal Club, and Biosis Previews for randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing abatacept alone or in combination with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD)/biologics to placebo or other DMARD/biologics in patients with RA. Two reviewers independently assessed search results, risk of bias, and extracted data. RESULTS: Seven trials with 2908 patients were included. Compared with placebo, patients with RA treated with abatacept were 2.2 times more likely to achieve an American College of Rheumatology 50% response (ACR50) at one year (relative risk 2.21, 95% CI 1.73, 2.82) with a 21% (95% CI 16%, 27%) absolute risk difference between groups. The number needed to treat to achieve an ACR50 response was 5 (95% CI 4, 7). Significantly greater improvements in physical function, disease activity, pain, and radiographic progression were noted in abatacept-treated patients compared to placebo. Total adverse events (AE) were greater in the abatacept group (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01, 1.08). Other harm outcomes were not significant, with the exception of serious infections at 12 months, which were more common in the abatacept group versus control group (Peto odds ratio 1.91, 95% CI 1.07, 3.42). Serious AE were more numerous in the abatacept + etanercept group versus the placebo + etanercept group (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.15, 4.62). CONCLUSION: Abatacept seems to be efficacious and safe in the treatment of RA. Abatacept should not be used in combination with other biologics to treat RA. Further longterm studies and postmarketing surveillance are required to assess for longer-term harms and sustained efficacy.			2010				527
Application of virtual reality to the rehabilitation field to aid amputee rehabilitation: findings from a systematic review		D'Angelo, M., Narayanan, S., Reynolds, D. B., Kotowski, S. and Page, S.				disability and rehabilitation. assistive technology	disability and rehabilitation. assistive technology	Purpose. To determine the scope and use of virtual reality (VR) applications in the gait rehabilitation field and to review and characterise VR approaches for application in amputee rehabilitation. Method. A state-of-the-art research analysis was completed to review different approaches of VR to the gait rehabilitation field. Systematic research using Medline, EBSCOhost and Science Direct (ISI Web of Knowledge) was conducted to analyse various VR rehabilitation methods, and we developed a framework to characterise different research findings. Results. Framework for a research approach in the field of VR and rehabilitation was developed based on the literature review. On the basis of outcomes from gait rehabilitation using VR, trials for amputee rehabilitation using VR is warranted and an outline of this potential VR rehabilitation area was identified. Conclusions. Evidence supports the investigation of VR as applied to amputee rehabilitation based on general gait rehabilitation results. Research should be expanded to better understand the role and use of technology in community-based rehabilitation to enhance the quality of life of individuals.			2010				173
A systematic review of pharmacologic treatments of pain after spinal cord injury		Teasell, R. W., Mehta, S., Aubut, J. A., Foulon, B., Wolfe, D. L., Hsieh, J. T., Townson, A. F., Short, C. and Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Evidence Research, Team				archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation	archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation	OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of published research on the pharmacologic treatment of pain after spinal cord injury (SCI). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles published 1980 to June 2009 addressing the treatment of pain post SCI. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed for methodologic quality using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) assessment scale, whereas non-RCTs were assessed by using the Downs and Black (D&B) evaluation tool. A level of evidence was assigned to each intervention by using a modified Sackett scale. STUDY SELECTION: The review included RCTs and non-RCTs, which included prospective controlled trials, cohort, case series, case-control, pre-post studies, and post studies. Case studies were included only when there were no other studies found. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extracted included the PEDro or D&B score, the type of study, a brief summary of intervention outcomes, the type of pain, the type of pain scale, and the study findings. DATA SYNTHESIS: Articles selected for this particular review evaluated different interventions in the pharmacologic management of pain after SCI. Twenty-eight studies met inclusion criteria; there were 21 randomized controlled trials; of these, 19 had level 1 evidence. Treatments were divided into 5 categories: anticonvulsants, antidepressants, analgesics, cannabinoids, and antispasticity medications. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies did not specify participants' types of pain, making it difficult to identify the type of pain being targeted by the treatment. Anticonvulsant and analgesic drugs had the highest levels of evidence and were the drugs most often studied. Gabapentin and pregabalin had strong evidence (5 level 1 RCTs) for effectiveness in treating post-SCI neuropathic pain as did intravenous analgesics (lidocaine, ketamine, and morphine), but the latter only had short-term benefits. Tricyclic antidepressants only showed benefit for neuropathic pain in depressed persons. Intrathecal baclofen reduced musculoskeletal pain associated with spasticity; however, there was conflicting evidence for the reduction in neuropathic pain. Studies assessing the effectiveness of opioids were limited and revealed only small benefits. Cannabinoids showed conflicting evidence in improving spasticity-related pain. Clonidine and morphine when given together had a significant synergistic neuropathic pain-relieving effect. Copyright © 2010 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine			2010				803
Open versus arthroscopic distal clavicle resection		Pensak, M., Grumet, R. C., Slabaugh, M. A. and Bach, B. R.				arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the arthroscopy association of north america and the international arthroscopy association	arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the arthroscopy association of north america and the international arthroscopy association	"PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to critically evaluate the available literature in an attempt to compare the outcome of open versus arthroscopic distal clavicle resection in the treatment of acromioclavicular joint pathology. METHODS: From January 1966 to December 2008, Medline was searched for the following key words: ""acromioclavicular joint arthritis,"" ""acromioclavicular osteolysis,"" ""distal clavicle excision,"" ""acromioclavicular joint excision,"" ""Mumford,"" and ""clavicle."" Inclusion criteria included studies that compared the outcome of open versus arthroscopic distal clavicle resection. Studies that could not be translated into the English language or were not published in a peer-reviewed journal were excluded. Data were abstracted from the studies, including patient demographics, surgical procedure, rehabilitation, strength, range of motion, and clinical scoring system. RESULTS: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria, including 2 Level II studies, 1 Level III and 14 Level IV studies. Arthroscopic distal clavicle excision results in more ""good"" or ""excellent"" outcomes compared with the open procedure. Both arthroscopic techniques result in success rates in excess of 90%, with the direct procedure permitting a quicker return to athletic activities. Performing distal clavicle excision in conjunction with either subacromial decompression or rotator cuff repair also has a high degree of success. A trend toward more ""poor"" results is seen when distal clavicle excision is performed in patients with post-traumatic acromioclavicular instability or in Workers' Compensation patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that among patients undergoing distal clavicle excision for acromioclavicular joint pathology, those having an arthroscopic procedure, specifically through the direct approach, can expect a faster return to activities while obtaining similar long-term outcomes compared with the open procedure.

Unplanned extubation in pediatric critically ill patients: a systematic review and best practice recommendations		Lucas da Silva, P. S. and de Carvalho, W. B.				pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the society of critical care medicine and the world federation of pediatric intensive and critical care societies	pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the society of critical care medicine and the world federation of pediatric intensive and critical care societies	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to update the state of knowledge of unplanned extubations in the pediatric population. The main topics addressed in the current literature on unplanned extubations were: 1) incidence; 2) risk factors; 3) risk factors for reintubation after unplanned extubations; and 4) strategies to prevent unplanned extubations. Based on this review we summarize and propose best practices in preventing unplanned extubations. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scielo, Lilacs, and Cochrane databases were searched for bibliography for the period spanning from January 1966 to March 2009. We used the following key words: unplanned extubation, accidental extubation, self extubation, unintentional extubation, unexpected extubation, inadvertent extubation, spontaneous extubation, and treatment interference. STUDY SELECTION: Eleven pediatric articles were eligible for data abstraction. Study quality was assessed using four levels of aggregate evidence adapted from the American Academy of Pediatrics. DATA SYNTHESIS: Unplanned extubations occurs at a rate of 0.11 to 2.27 events per 100 intubation days. Risk factors associated with unplanned extubations were age (younger patients), inadequate tube fixation, agitation, copious secretions, performance of patient procedures, and nursing workload. Reintubation rates ranged from 14% to 65% of unplanned extubations. Three cohort studies evaluated the effectiveness of strategies in reducing unplanned extubations. One study reported the institution of a standardized algorithm of goal-directed sedation, whereas two studies evaluated the implementation of a continuous quality-improvement program. These studies reported significant reductions in unplanned extubations rate after program implementation. Methods of securing the endotracheal tube varied across studies and the use of physical restraints yielded conflicting findings. CONCLUSIONS: There are few studies assessing unplanned extubations in pediatric intensive care units. The available quality studies have shown that improvement of quality components is effective in reducing unplanned extubations. Although further rigorous studies are needed to establish strong recommendations on unplanned extubations prevention, we present a summary of recommendations based on review of the current literature.			2010				485
Cancer-related pain management: a report of evidence-based recommendations to guide practice		Green, E., Zwaal, C., Beals, C., Fitzgerald, B., Harle, I., Jones, J., Tsui, J., Volpe, J., Yoshimoto, D. and Wiernikowski, J.				the clinical journal of pain	the clinical journal of pain	OBJECTIVES: Cancer may be associated with many symptoms, but pain is the one most feared by patients. Pain is experienced by one-third of patients receiving treatment for cancer and about two-thirds of those with advanced cancers. To aid in providing quality care and pain relief for cancer patients, Cancer Care Ontario's Cancer-related Pain Management Guideline Panel conducted a systematic review of guidelines to provide evidence-based and consensus recommendations for the management of cancer-related pain to guide the practice of healthcare providers. METHODS: Published and unpublished cancer-related pain management guidelines were sought by conducting an Internet search, which included health organizations and the National Guidelines Clearinghouse, the Guideline International Network, and the McMillan Group. Also, MEDLINE searches were conducted for guidelines published between the years 2000 and May 2006. RESULTS: Twenty-five guidelines were found and the quality of each guideline was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guideline Research and Evaluation Instrument and the utility of the guideline for recommendations was assessed. Using these 2 criteria, 8 relevant and high-quality pain guidelines were identified. From these guidelines, the Panel articulated core principles of the management of cancer pain and selected or adapted specific recommendations through consensus to become a part of the cancer-related pain guide for practice. DISCUSSION: The domains on which recommendations were drafted include: assessment of pain; assessors of pain; time and frequency of assessment; components of pain assessment; assessment of pain in special populations; plan of care; pharmacologic intervention; nonpharmacologic intervention; documentation; education; and outcome measures of cancer-pain management.			2010				286
A systematic review of the quality of psychometric evidence supporting the use of an obesity-specific quality of life measure for use with persons who have class III obesity		Forhan, M., Vrkljan, B. and MacDermid, J.				obesity reviews : an official journal of the international association for the study of obesity	obesity reviews : an official journal of the international association for the study of obesity	With global obesity rates at 42%, there is a need for high-quality outcome measures that capture important aspects of quality of life for persons with obesity. The aim of this paper was to systematically review and critique the psychometric properties and utility of the impact of weight on quality of life-lite (IWQOL-Lite) for use with persons who have class III obesity. Databases were searched for articles that addressed obesity-specific quality of life. A critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of the IWQOL-Lite and connection to a quality of life conceptual framework was completed. Raters used a standardized data extraction and quality appraisal form to guide evidence extraction. Two articles that reviewed obesity-specific quality of life measures were found; none were based on a systematic review. Six articles on the IWQOL-Lite met the criteria for critical appraisal using guidelines. The mean quality score for these articles was 59.2%. Concepts measured were consistent with the biopsychosocial concept of health defined by the World Health Organization. There is limited but consistent evidence that the IWQOL-Lite is a reliable, valid and responsive outcome measure that can be used to assess disease-specific quality of life in persons with class III obesity.			2010				242
Effect of directly observed therapy for highly active antiretroviral therapy on virologic, immunologic, and adherence outcomes: a meta-analysis and systematic review		Hart, J. E., Jeon, C. Y., Ivers, L. C., Behforouz, H. L., Caldas, A., Drobac, P. C. and Shin, S. S.				journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)	journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)	INTRODUCTION: Directly observed therapy of highly active antiretroviral therapy (DOT-HAART) is a feasible adherence intervention. Prospective DOT-HAART studies have shown mixed results, and optimal target groups have yet to be defined. We performed a meta-analysis and systematic review to assess the effect of DOT-HAART on adherence and virologic and immunologic response. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search through August 2009 to identify peer-reviewed controlled studies that involved outpatient DOT-HAART among adults and reported at least 1 outcome assessed in this meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed; differences in effect on virologic suppression were examined using stratified meta-analyses and meta-regression on several study characteristics. RESULTS: Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria. Compared with control groups, DOT-HAART recipients were more likely to achieve an undetectable viral load (random effects risk ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.41), a greater increase in CD4 cell count (random effects weighted mean difference 43 cells/microL, 95% CI: 12 to 74 cells/microL), and HAART adherence of > or =95% (random effects risk ratio 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.32). Results varied with respect to virologic response. DOT-HAART did not have a significant effect on virologic suppression when restricted to randomized controlled studies. Post-treatment effect was not observed in a limited number of studies. CONCLUSIONS: DOT-HAART had a significant effect on virologic, immunologic, and adherence outcomes, although its efficacy was not supported when restricting analysis to randomized controlled trials. DOT-HAART shows greatest treatment effect when targeting individuals with greater risk of nonadherence and when delivering the intervention that maximizes participant convenience and provides enhanced adherence support. Further investigation is needed to assess the postintervention effect and cost-effectiveness of DOT-HAART.			2010				303
The Effects of Open versus Closed Kinetic Chain Exercises on Patients with ACL Deficient or Reconstructed Knees: A Systematic Review		Glass, R., Waddell, J. and Hoogenboom, B.				north american journal of sports physical therapy : najspt	north american journal of sports physical therapy : najspt	BACKGROUND: There is no consensus among the existing published evidence as to whether closed kinetic chain (CKC) or open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises should be the intervention of choice following an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury or reconstruction. The commonly held belief has been that OKC exercises cause increased strain on the ACL as well as increased joint laxity and anterior tibial translation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of OKC and CKC exercises on the knees of patients with ACL deficiency or reconstruction. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, ProQuest Medical Library, and CINAHL STUDY SELECTION: Six articles were chosen for inclusion in the systematic review. The authors narrowed 50 articles down to 6 by review of titles and abstracts. Included articles were randomized controlled trials written in English, published during 2000-2008, that evaluated the effects of OKC and CKC exercises on ACL deficient or reconstructed knees. DATA EXTRACTION: Quality of the included studies was defined by the PEDro scale(1), which has been found to be reliable.(2) DATA SYNTHESIS: Scores on the PEDro scale(1) ranged from 4-6/10. One article found positive significant effects with inclusion of OKC exercises in the rehabilitation program and another found significant benefits with combining OKC and CKC exercises. CKC exercises alone were not found by any studies to be superior to OKC exercises. CONCLUSION: These studies reveal favorable results for utilization of both open and closed kinetic chain exercises for intervention with ACL deficient or reconstructed knees. However, further research needs to be completed.			2010				271
Patient navigation in breast cancer: a systematic review		Robinson-White, S., Conroy, B., Slavish, K. H. and Rosenzweig, M.				cancer nursing	cancer nursing	"BACKGROUND:: The role of the patient navigator in cancer care and specifically in breast cancer care has grown to incorporate many titles and functions. OBJECTIVE:: To better evaluate the outcomes of patient navigation in breast cancer care, a comprehensive review of empiric literature detailing the efficacy of breast cancer navigation on breast cancer outcomes (screening, diagnosis, treatment, and participation in clinical research) was performed. METHODS:: Published articles were reviewed if published in the scientific literature between January 1990 and April 2009. Searches were conducted using PubMed and Ovid databases. Search terms included MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms, ""patient navigator,"" ""navigation,"" ""breast cancer,"" and ""adherence."" RESULTS:: Data-based literature indicates that the role of patient navigation is diverse with multiple roles and targeted populations. Navigation across many aspects of the breast cancer disease trajectory improves adherence to breast cancer care. The empiric review found that navigation interventions have been more commonly applied in breast cancer screening and early diagnosis than for adherence to treatment. CONCLUSION:: There is evidence supporting the role of patient navigation in breast cancer to improve many aspects of breast cancer care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:: Data describing the role of patient navigation in breast cancer will assist in better defining future direction for the breast navigation role. Ongoing research will better inform issues related to role definition, integration into clinical breast cancer care, impact on quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability."			2010				700
Prevention and early intervention to improve mental health in higher education students: a review		Reavley, N. and Jorm, A. F.				early intervention in psychiatry	early intervention in psychiatry	BACKGROUND: The age at which most young people are in higher education is also the age of peak onset for mental and substance use disorders, with these having their first onset before age 24 in 75% of cases. In most developed countries, over 50% of young people are in higher education. AIMS: To review the evidence for prevention and early intervention in mental health problems in higher education students. The review was limited to interventions targeted to anxiety, depression and alcohol misuse. METHODS: Interventions to review were identified by searching PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Interventions were included if they were designed to specifically prevent or intervene early in the general (non-health professional) higher education student population, in one or more of the following areas: anxiety, depression or alcohol misuse symptoms, mental health literacy, stigma and one or more behavioural outcomes. RESULTS: For interventions to prevent or intervene early for alcohol misuse, evidence of effectiveness is strongest for brief motivational interventions and for personalized normative interventions delivered using computers or in individual face-to-face sessions. Few interventions to prevent or intervene early with depression or anxiety were identified. These were mostly face-to-face, cognitive-behavioural/skill-based interventions. One social marketing intervention to raise awareness of depression and treatments showed some evidence of effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: There is very limited evidence that interventions are effective in preventing or intervening early with depression and anxiety disorders in higher education students. Further studies, possibly involving interventions that have shown promise in other populations, are needed.			2010				680
Improving child protection in the emergency department: a systematic review of professional interventions for health care providers		Newton, A. S., Zou, B., Hamm, M. P., Curran, J., Gupta, S., Dumonceaux, C. and Lewis, M.				academic emergency medicine : official journal of the society for academic emergency medicine	academic emergency medicine : official journal of the society for academic emergency medicine	OBJECTIVES: This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of professional and organizational interventions aimed at improving medical processes, such as documentation or clinical assessments by health care providers, in the care of pediatric emergency department (ED) patients where abuse was suspected. METHODS: A search of electronic databases, references, key journals, and conference proceedings was conducted and primary authors were contacted. Studies whose purpose was to evaluate a strategy aimed at improving ED clinical care of suspected abuse were included. Study methodologic quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. One reviewer extracted the data, and a second checked for completeness and accuracy. RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria: one randomized controlled trial (RCT), one quasi-RCT, and four observational studies. Study quality ranged from modest (observational studies) to good (trials). Variation in study interventions and outcomes limited between-study comparisons. The quasi-RCT supported self-instructional education kits as a means to improve physician knowledge for both physical abuse (mean +/- standard deviation [SD] pretest score = 13.12 +/- 2.36; mean +/- SD posttest score = 18.16 +/- 1.64) and sexual abuse (mean +/- SD pretest score = 10.81 +/- 3.20; mean +/- SD posttest score = 18.45 +/- 1.79). Modest-quality observational studies evaluated reminder systems for physician documentation with similar results across studies. Compared to standard practice, chart checklists paired with an educational program increased physician consideration of nonaccidental burns in burn cases (59% increase), documentation of time of injury (36% increase), and documentation of consistency (53% increase) and compatibility (55% increase) of reported histories. Decisional flow charts for suspected physical abuse also increased documentation of nonaccidental physical injury (69.5% increase; p < 0.0001) and had a similar significant effect as checklists on increasing documentation of history consistency and compatibility (69.5 and 70.0% increases, respectively; p < 0.0001) when compared to standard practice. No improvements were noted in these studies for documentation of consultations or current status with child protective services. The introduction of a specialized team and crisis center to standardize practice had little effect on physician documentation, but did increase documentation of child protective services involvement (22.7% increase; p < 0.005) and discharge status (23.7% increase; p < 0.02). Referral to social services increased in one study following the introduction of a chart checklist (8.6% increase; p = 0.018). A recently conducted multisite RCT did not support observational findings, reporting no significant effect of educational sessions and/or a chart checklist on ED practices. CONCLUSIONS: The small number of studies identified in this review highlights the need for future quality studies that address care of a vulnerable clinical population. While moderate-quality observational studies suggest that education and reminder systems increase clinical knowledge and documentation, these findings are not supported by a multisite randomized trial. The limited theoretical base for conceptualizing change in health care providers and the influence of the ED environment on clinical practice are limitations to this current evidence base.			2010				594

Vegetative state and minimally conscious state: a review of the therapeutic interventions		Georgiopoulos, M., Katsakiori, P., Kefalopoulou, Z., Ellul, J., Chroni, E. and Constantoyannis, C.				stereotactic and functional neurosurgery	stereotactic and functional neurosurgery	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The purpose of the present article is a systematic review of the proposed medical or surgical treatments in patients in chronic vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS), as well as of their mechanisms of action and limitations. METHODS: For this review, we have agreed to include patients in VS or MCS having persisted for over 6 months in posttraumatic cases, and over 3 months in nontraumatic cases, before the time of intervention. Searches were independently conducted by 2 investigators between May 2009 and September 2009 in the following databases: Medline, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. The electronic search was complemented by cross-checking the references of all relevant articles. Overall, 16 papers were eligible for this systematic review. RESULTS: According to the 16 eligible studies, medical management by dopaminergic agents (levodopa, amantadine), zolpidem and median nerve stimulation, or surgical management by deep brain stimulation, extradural cortical stimulation, spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal baclofen have shown to improve the level of consciousness in certain cases. CONCLUSION: The treatments proposed for disorders of consciousness have not yet gained the level of 'evidence-based treatments'; moreover, the studies to date have led to inconclusiveness. The published therapeutic responses must be substantiated by further clinical studies of sound methodology.			2010				265
Comparison of the postoperative analgesic efficacy of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with tramadol to intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with opioids		Murphy, J. D., Yan, D., Hanna, M. N., Bravos, E. D., Isaac, G. R., Eng, C. A. and Wu, C. L.				journal of opioid management	journal of opioid management	"BACKGROUND: Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) with tramadol is an accepted method to deliver postoperative analgesia outside North America; however, the analgesic efficacy of this analgesic agent when compared with IVPCA with opioids is uncertain. As such, the authors undertook a systematic review to compare the analgesic efficacy of IVPCA tramadol with that of IVPCA with opioids. METHODS: The authors used the National Library of Medicine's Medline database to search for terms related to tramadol and patient-controlled analgesia. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IVPCA tramadol with IVPCA opioid and RCTs published in the English language. Relevant data were abstracted from accepted studies. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2.10 (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2004). A random effects model was used. RESULTS: A total of 190 abstracts were obtained from the above search, and a total of 12 RCTs met the above inclusion criteria. There was no difference in weighted visual analog scale pain scores between IVPCA tramadol versus IVPCA opioid at 48 hours postoperatively or risk of sedation or fatigue. IVPCA tramadol was associated with a higher odds of postoperative nausea and vomiting [odds ratio (OR) = 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-2.14) but a lower odds of pruritus (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.19-0.98). DISCUSSION: IVPCA tramadol appears to produce similar pain scores when compared with that from IVPCA opioids; however, the side effect profile is different between the two groups. Because of the relatively small sample size, no determination of the relative ""safety"" (eg, respiratory depression) of one regimen over the other can be made, and larger RCTs would be needed for such a determination."			2010				581
A systematic review of the treatment of nausea and/or vomiting in cancer unrelated to chemotherapy or radiation		Davis, M. P., Hallerberg, G. and Palliative Medicine Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in, Cancer				journal of pain and symptom management	journal of pain and symptom management	"CONTEXT: A systematic review of antiemetics for emesis in cancer unrelated to chemotherapy and radiation is an important step in establishing treatment recommendations and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic review based on the question ""What is the evidence that supports antiemetic choices in advanced cancer?"" guided this review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the level of evidence for antiemtrics in the management of nausea and vomiting in advanced cancer unrelated to chemotherapy and radiation, and to discover gaps in the evidence, which would provide important areas for future research. METHODS: Three databases and independent searches using different MeSH terms were performed. Related links were searched and hand searches of related articles were made. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective single-drug studies, studies that used guidelines based on the etiology of emesis, cohort studies, retrospective studies, and case series or single-patient reports. Studies that involved treatment of chemotherapy, radiation, or postoperation-related emesis were excluded. Studies that involved the treatment of emesis related to bowel obstruction were included. The strength of evidence was graded as follows: 1) RCTs, A; 2) single-drug prospective studies, B1; 3) studies based on multiple drug choices for etiology of emesis, B2; and 4) cohort, case series, retrospective, and single-patient reports, E. Level of evidence was determined by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence (May 2001) (A, B, C, D). RESULTS: Ninety-three articles were found. Fourteen were RCTs, most of them of low quality, based either on lack of blinding, lack of description of the method of randomization, concealment, and/or attrition. Metoclopramide had modest evidence (B) based on RCTs and prospective cohort studies. Octreotide, dexamethasone, and hyoscine butylbromide are effective in reducing symptoms of bowel obstruction, based on prospective studies and/or one RCT. There was no evidence that either multiple antiemetics or antiemetic choices based on the etiology of emesis were any better than a single antiemetic. There is poor evidence for dose response, intraclass or interclass drug switch, or antiemetic combinations in those individuals failing to respond to the initial antiemetic. CONCLUSION: There are discrepancies between antiemetic studies and published antiemetic guidelines, which are largely based on expert opinion. Antiemetic recommendations have moderate to weak evidence at best. Prospective randomized trials of single antiemetics are needed to properly establish evidence-based guidelines."			2010				179
Clinical outcome of acute leg ischaemia due to thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm: systematic review of 895 cases		Kropman, R. H., Schrijver, A. M., Kelder, J. C., Moll, F. L. and de Vries, J. P.				european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	OBJECTIVES: A systematic review was performed to summarise outcomes of acute thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) treated with thrombolysis or thrombectomy followed by bypass. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of data on acute thrombosed PAAs dated 1 January 1990 through 30 June 2008 using the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Primary endpoint was limb salvage; secondary endpoints were mortality and patency of the bypasses. RESULTS: Eight prospective studies and 25 retrospective studies with 895 patients presenting with acute ischaemia were included. No randomised trials were included. The mortality rate after surgical repair was 3.2% (95% confidence interval (C.I.) 1.8-4.6). The amputation rate was 14.1% (95% C.I. 11.8-16.4). Thrombolysis before surgery did not result in a significant reduction of the number of amputations, compared with surgery (thrombectomy and bypass) alone. The mean primary patency rates of the bypasses at 1, 3 and 5 years were 79%, 77% and 74%, respectively, in the 'thrombolysis' group and 71% (P=0.026), 54% (P=0.164) and 45% (P=0.249) in the 'thrombectomy' group. No distinction could be made regarding secondary patency and limb-salvage rates between the groups owing to insufficient data. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative and intra-operative thrombolyses result in a significant improvement in 1-year primary graft patency rates, but do not result in a significant reduction for amputations compared with surgery alone.			2010				423
Intermittent pneumatic compression or graduated compression stockings for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis? A systematic review of direct clinical comparisons		Morris, R. J. and Woodcock, J. P.				annals of surgery	annals of surgery	OBJECTIVE: To review the relative efficacy of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and graduated compression stockings (GCS) stated in direct clinical comparisons. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Both IPC and GCS are recommended for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in surgical patients. Although both are known to be effective, guidance is less clear on the clinical grounds for choosing between the 2 devices. METHODS: Major medical databases were searched for trial reports published between January 1970 and August 2008. All trials comprising a direct clinical comparison between IPC and GCS were reviewed. RESULTS: Ten direct comparisons were found, 9 of which were with surgical patients. The difference in DVT outcome only reached statistic significance in 3, all of which showed IPC to have the lower DVT rate. Five of the trials that did not produce statistic significance included fewer than 40 patients in each study group. The crude cumulated DVT rate for all the trials was 5.9% for GCS and 2.8% for IPC. CONCLUSION: There is only weak evidence to show a difference in performance between the devices, however, given the many influential factors, caution should be taken in assuming equivalence.			2010				569
[Vitamin D3 in prevention of diseases in adults--a systematic review]		?ach, K. and Krajewski-Siuda, K.				wiadomo?ci lekarskie (warsaw, poland : 1960)	wiadomo?ci lekarskie (warsaw, poland : 1960)	"INTRODUCTION: Current evidence indicates that vitamin D3 plays significant role in calcium balance and bone metabolism through lifetime. There are also evidence on preventive efficacy of vitamin D3 in diabetes, insulin-resistance, hypertension and malignancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The aim of the systematic review was to gather evidence regarding vitamin D3 in prevention of diseases in adults. MEDLINE via Pubmed was searched using key words: ""vitamin D3, ""prevention"", ""adults"", ""cardiovascular diseases"", cancer"", ""osteoporosis"", ""common cold"", ""cold"", ""diabetes"", ""obesity"", ""depression"". 26 trials were included into analysis: 17 randomized clinical trials, five observational studies, two systematic reviews, and two metaanalysis. RESULTS: Vitamin D3 appears to has beneficial effect in depression therapy, protective effect on beta-cells in diabetic patients and reducing frequency of adverse events such as thrombosis in patients with prostate cancer. Supplementing with vitamin D3 results with no significant improve in reducing body weight, fat, blood pressure, risk of hypertension, level of lipids in serum, response to treatment in cancer prostate (together with dexamethasone and carboplatin). Many studies highlights beneficial influence of vitamin D3 with calcium on bone mineral density in whole body. Another studies show improve in bone mineral density in hips and pelvic bones only. There were inconsistencies of studies results regarding role of vitamin D3 in prevention of diabetes, risk of breast cancer and influence on bone mineral density. CONCLUSIONS: Despite all inconsistencies supplementation of vitamin D3 is important and plays role in effective osteoporotic management and there is evidence on preventive efficacy of vitamin D3 in different diseases."			2010				436
Nutritional effects of implant therapy in edentulous patients--a systematic review		Sánchez-Ayala, A., Lagravère, M. O., Gonçalves, T. M., Lucena, S. C. and Barbosa, C. M.				implant dentistry	implant dentistry	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to present all the relevant studies that have evaluated, with valid scientific methodology, the possible physical and nutrient intake improvement of edentulous subjects rehabilitated with removable and supported or retained implant denture, without restriction of suprastructure modalities, compared with those wearing conventional removable dentures. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Several electronic databases (Pubmed, Medline-Medline In-Process, Cochrane Library Database, Embase, and Lilacs) were searched, without language limitation. References from the selected articles were also hand searched. Abstracts which appeared to fulfill the initial selection criteria (comparison of nutritional state between conventional removable and supported or retained implant denture wearers) were selected by consensus and their original articles were then retrieved. Clinical trials that included anthropometric measurements or nutrient intake in removable and supported or retained implant denture wearers without syndrome and systemic influences, nor presenting surgical or other simultaneous treatment, which could affect the integrity during the evaluation period were finally selected. RESULTS: Only 5 articles met the selection criteria. Two studies (randomized clinical trials and prospective) found inadequate nutrient intake after treatment. One randomized clinical trial presented an improvement in nutritional state after treatment. One cross-sectional study showed an adequate nutritional state before and after treatment. These 4 studies found no significant difference between implant and conventional treatments. Finally, 1 cross-sectional study presented a difference between treatments, showing that the risk of malnutrition was higher for removable complete denture wearers. CONCLUSION: Considering the available evidence, the effect on the nutritional state in edentulous subjects treated with implant therapy is similar to the 1 obtained with conventional removable dentures. This effect does not necessarily mean an optimum nutritional state, which also depends on other factors not related to prosthodontic treatment.			2010				723
A systematic narrative review of the studies on structured child-centred interventions for families with a parent with cancer		Niemelä, M., Hakko, H. and Räsänen, S.				psycho-oncology	psycho-oncology	OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic narrative review of the current state of published articles on the structured interventions targeted at children with a parent suffering from cancer. METHODS: The study was based on a narrative synthesis approach. Eleven structured child-centred intervention studies were systematically searched through PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE. The interventions were grouped into two main categories: 'structured family interventions' and 'structured peer group interventions'. Special attention was focused on the preventive purpose of the interventions. RESULTS: The participants (children, parents and health professionals) reported several positive impacts of interventions on children's and parents' psychosocial well-being, although no improvement or changes were also observed. The effect of interventions on the children was evaluated by structured methods only in five studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review showed the lack of valid psychosocial preventive intervention methods focusing on children with parental cancer and highlighted the need of intervention research with controlled study designs and long follow-up periods. However, an intervention method should be easy to train and applicable to the clinical practice of healthcare professionals. By refining the practice-based experiences with scientific research evidence it is possible to move to the next level in providing psychosocial support and prevention for children living in families with parental cancer.			2010				602
Secondary interventions following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and the enduring value of graft surveillance		Nordon, I. M., Karthikesalingam, A., Hinchliffe, R. J., Holt, P. J., Loftus, I. M. and Thompson, M. M.				european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	OBJECTIVE: Lifelong imaging surveillance is currently recommended for all patients following endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVR). The modality, timing and overall necessity of surveillance has recently been brought into question. This review reports contemporary secondary intervention rates and explores surveillance imaging pick-up rates and reports the evidence supporting modified EVR surveillance programs. DESIGN: Systematic review of literature (2002-2009) and meta-analysis of Kaplan-Meier re-intervention-free survival estimates. RESULTS: 32 Papers were included in final analysis. 17,987 EVR cases were reported. Crude annual secondary intervention rates from the US population registries were 3.7%/year (range 1.7-4.3%). Combined re-intervention-free survival estimates, from 14 series (10,365 cases), demonstrated a linear progression with 89.9%, 86.9% and 81.5% of grafts without secondary procedures at 2, 3 and 5 years respectively. 3 Reports (1249 cases) differentiated between interventions directed by surveillance or outside surveillance protocols. Surveillance imaging alone initiated the secondary interventions in 1.4-9% of cases; >90% of EVR cases received no benefits from surveillance scans. DISCUSSION: Some format of surveillance following EVR probably remains necessary despite a reduction in secondary interventions with modern stent-grafts. Surveillance should be targeted at those stent-grafts and patients at high risk of complications. Further work is justified to identify this group.			2010				606
Methods for the systematic reviews on patient safety during spine surgery		Dettori, J. R., Norvell, D. C., Dekutoski, M., Fisher, C. and Chapman, J. R.				spine	spine	STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To provide a detailed description of the methods undertaken in the systematic search and analytical summary of patient safety issues in spinal surgery, and to describe the process used to come to a clinical recommendation regarding challenges in the management of patients undergoing spine surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A solid understanding of complication type, incidence, risk factors, and impact is implicit to the physician's role in developing an informed patient centered decision with respect to surgical intervention. We present methods used in conducting the systematic, evidence-based reviews, and expert panel recommendations of key challenges to the spine surgical practice. It is our desire that spine surgeons will use the information from these reviews together with an understanding of their own capacities and experience to better inform patients with respect to potential treatment outcomes, safety, and life impact. METHODS: A systematic search and critical review of the English language literature was undertaken for articles published on the safety of various surgical spine conditions. Citations were screened for relevance using a priori criteria, and relevant studies were critically reviewed. The strength of evidence for the overall body of literature in each topic area was determined by 2 independent reviewers considering study quality, study quantity, and consistency of results. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Findings from studies meeting inclusion criteria were summarized. From these summaries, clinical recommendations were formulated from consensus achieved among subject experts through the Delphi process. RESULTS: We identified and screened 2020 citations in 13 topic areas relating to safety in spine surgery. Of these, 273 met our predetermined inclusion criteria and were used to attempt to answer specific clinical questions within each topic area. CONCLUSION: We undertook systematic reviews to establish a baseline of the current evidence on patient safety issues in spine surgery. This article reports the methods used in the reviews.			2010				195
Knowledge translation to fitness trainers: a systematic review		Stacey, D., Hopkins, M., Adamo, K. B., Shorr, R. and Prud'homme, D.				implementation science : is	implementation science : is	BACKGROUND: This study investigates approaches for translating evidence-based knowledge for use by fitness trainers. Specific questions were: Where do fitness trainers get their evidence-based information? What types of interventions are effective for translating evidence-based knowledge for use by fitness trainers? What are the barriers and facilitators to the use of evidence-based information by fitness trainers in their practice? METHODS: We describe a systematic review of studies about knowledge translation interventions targeting fitness trainers. Fitness trainers were defined as individuals who provide exercise program design and supervision services to the public. Nurses, physicians, physiotherapists, school teachers, athletic trainers, and sport team strength coaches were excluded. RESULTS: Of 634 citations, two studies were eligible for inclusion: a survey of 325 registered health fitness professionals (66% response rate) and a qualitative study of 10 fitness instructors. Both studies identified that fitness trainers obtain information from textbooks, networking with colleagues, scientific journals, seminars, and mass media. Fitness trainers holding higher levels of education are reported to use evidence-based information sources such as scientific journals compared to those with lower education levels, who were reported to use mass media sources. The studies identified did not evaluate interventions to translate evidence-based knowledge for fitness trainers and did not explore factors influencing uptake of evidence in their practice. CONCLUSION: Little is known about how fitness trainers obtain and incorporate new evidence-based knowledge into their practice. Further exploration and specific research is needed to better understand how emerging health-fitness evidence can be translated to maximize its use by fitness trainers providing services to the general public.			2010				782
Safety baseballs and chest protectors: a systematic review on the prevention of commotio cordis		Classie, J. A., Distel, L. M. and Borchers, J. R.				the physician and sportsmedicine	the physician and sportsmedicine	"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether chest protectors and/or safety baseballs reduce the incidence of commotio cordis during sport through a review of the best available evidence. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Ovid Medline, and Embase databases from 1950 to 2009. We selected articles according to ""death, sudden, cardiac,"" ""commotio cordis,"" ""sports equipment,"" and ""protective devices."" We identified 17 articles in the systematic literature search. Of these, 7 articles met inclusion criteria. Three independent reviewers reviewed the articles. The study results and generated conclusions were extracted and agreed on. RESULTS: The softest safety baseball shows statistically significant reductions in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) at all velocities compared with standard baseballs in the 3 studies that evaluated their use. Different degrees of softness did not show statistically significant reductions in VF. In the 3 studies that evaluated the use of chest protectors against controls, there was an increase in protection against fatal arrhythmias; however, this was only statistically significant for 1 chest protector. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows strong supportive evidence toward a decreased rate of commotio cordis with safety baseballs when compared with standard balls. Based on the results of our systematic review, the rate of induction of VF was at its lowest when chest protection was used."			2010				153
Infection control measures for norovirus: a systematic review of outbreaks in semi-enclosed settings		Harris, J. P., Lopman, B. A. and O'Brien, S. J.				the journal of hospital infection	the journal of hospital infection	We carried out a review of published, peer-reviewed articles to assess the evidence for effectiveness of control measures during norovirus outbreaks in enclosed settings. There were 47 papers identified for review, some of which reported more than one outbreak, providing 72 outbreaks for analysis. We extracted the following data items: attack rates; the number of people affected and at risk, case or outbreak definition; whether outbreak control measures were implemented; and claims of effectiveness of interventions. We analysed the data to identify any differences in the outbreaks experienced in different settings and any differences experienced during outbreaks according to whether control measures were implemented or not. All of the reviewed papers described outbreaks occurring in industrialised countries. We found no evidence that implementing infection control measures affected the duration of outbreaks, or the attack rates either overall (all settings combined) or within particular settings. The median outbreak duration was 16 days (range: 1-44) compared with 14 (range: 2-92) where control measures were and were not utilized, respectively. Sound infection control procedures are key to controlling norovirus outbreaks but unfortunately, the present body of the published literature does not provide an evidence-base for the value of specific measures.			2010				302
A systematic review of the effectiveness of smoking relapse prevention interventions for abstinent smokers		Agboola, S., McNeill, A., Coleman, T. and Leonardi Bee, J.				addiction (abingdon, england)	addiction (abingdon, england)	Aims To carry out a systematic review of the effectiveness of relapse prevention interventions (RPIs) among abstinent smokers who had completed an initial course of treatment or who had abstained unassisted, pooling only outcome data from similar follow-up time points. Methods We used the same search strategy as was used in Cochrane reviews of RPIs to identify randomized trials of behavioural and pharmacological studies of smoking RPIs published up to July 2008. Abstinence from smoking was defined as either continuous abstinence or point prevalence abstinence, measured at three follow-up time points: short term (1-3 months post randomization), medium term (6-9 months) and long term (12-18 months). Abstinence among pregnant/postpartum women was also measured at delivery or the last follow-up prior to delivery. Random effect meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Thirty-six studies randomizing abstainers were included. Self-help materials appeared to be effective in preventing relapse at long-term follow up in initially unaided quitters (pooled OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.01, I2 = 0%, NNT = 11, 3 studies). Other behavioural interventions for relapse prevention appeared effective in the short term only. There were positive results for the use of pharmacotherapies for relapse prevention. Bupropion was effective at long-term follow-up (pooled OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.01; I2 = 0%; NNT = 11; 4 studies). Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was effective at medium-term (pooled OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.11; I2 = 37%; NNT = 14; 4 trials) and long-term follow-ups (pooled OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.63; I2 = 0%; NNT = 20; 4 trials). Single trials of extended treatment of Varenicline and rimonabant were also found to be effective at short-term and medium-term follow-ups. Conclusions Self-help materials appear to prevent relapse in initially unaided quitters. Use of NRT, bupropion and varenicline appears to be effective in preventing relapse following an initial period of abstinence or an acute treatment episode. There is currently no good evidence that behavioural support prevents relapse after initial unaided abstinence or following an acute treatment period.			2010				12
Immobilization Regime Following Lateral Patellar Dislocation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Current Evidence Base		Smith, T. O., Davies, L. and Donell, S. T.				european journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the european trauma society	european journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the european trauma society	Historically, patients following patellar dislocation have been immobilized in a cylinder plaster of Paris cast for around 6 weeks. However, there remains controversy over whether immobilization should be advocated following this injury. There also remains debate over the methods and duration for which patients are immobilized. A systematic review was undertaken to assess these questions. The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and AMED, in addition to a review of unpublished material, was undertaken. All of the included papers were appraised using the CASP appraisal tool. Two studies were eligible, assessing the outcomes of 177 lateral patellar dislocations. The results suggested that there is no significant difference in clinical outcomes when using a cylinder cast or posterior splint in full extension compared to an elastic bandage. No studies were identified specifically assessing the clinical outcomes of patients immobilized compared to those not immobilized, or assessing different durations of immobilization. The present evidence base is insufficient in both size and methodological quality to justify the use of immobilization for patients following a lateral patellar dislocation.			2010				768
Impact of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure: an updated, post-TREAT meta-analysis		Desai, A., Lewis, E., Solomon, S., McMurray, J. J. and Pfeffer, M.				european journal of heart failure	european journal of heart failure	AIMS: Randomized clinical trials have suggested that treatment of anaemia with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in patients with cancer or chronic kidney disease may increase cardiovascular risk. We therefore examined the effect of treating anaemia with an ESA in patients with heart failure in a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, including the recently reported TREAT study. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all prospective, randomized, controlled studies of ESAs enrolling patients with heart failure and reporting data on mortality or non-fatal heart failure events. Of 10 trials initially identified by our search strategy, we pooled data from 9 placebo-controlled studies enrolling a total of 2039 patients, of whom 1023 (50.2%) were allocated to ESA treatment. The pooled risk ratio for ESA treatment relative to placebo was 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-1.21, P = 0.68] for overall mortality and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.82-1.10, P = 0.46) for worsening heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ESAs to manage anaemia in patients with heart failure was associated with a neutral effect on both mortality and non-fatal heart failure events. Definitive assessment of the balance of risk and benefit in this population awaits the completion of a randomized clinical trial adequately powered to assess clinical outcomes.			2010				194
Hysterectomy or a minimal invasive alternative? A systematic review on quality of life and satisfaction		Brölmann, H. A., Bijdevaate, A. J., Vonk Noordegraaf, A., Janssen, P. F. and Huirne, J. A.				gynecological surgery	gynecological surgery	Nowadays, an increasing number of minimal invasive treatment alternatives to hysterectomy may be offered to the patient. In determining the appropriate treatment option, the patient has a distinct dilemma if a minimal invasive treatment with lesser effect than hysterectomy should be chosen or if a hysterectomy should be chosen which is a major surgery and requires longer recovery than the minimal invasive alternative. Quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires that take subjective health perception into account are currently used to assess the treatment effects. The objective of this literature study is to determine and discuss the role of QoL as an outcome in randomized controlled trials (RCT) or systematic reviews of RCTs that study the treatment effect of hysterectomy compared to that of minimal invasive alternatives. A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed database and in the Cochrane database to find randomized trials and systematic reviews of randomized trials, comparing hysterectomy with minimal invasive or conservative treatment options with sufficient follow-up using satisfaction, health status, and quality of life as outcomes. The results were based on nine randomized trials and two systematic reviews. The differences are mostly in favor of hysterectomy. In two out of four studied treatment alternatives, the satisfaction or health status is different in favor of hysterectomy while the QoL is equivalent. After 2 years of follow-up, differences between both groups have disappeared, possibly because of the crossover effect. Possible reasons for the lesser response of QoL compared to satisfaction or health status are discussed. The fundamental question if patients have a better quality of life at all times if they choose for a minimal invasive alternative of hysterectomy remains unresolved. Information, individualization, and freedom of choice before surgery probably best serve the sense of well being and quality of life thereafter.			2010				98
Educational and behavioral interventions for asthma: who achieves which outcomes? A systematic review		Clark, N. M., Griffiths, C., Keteyian, S. R. and Partridge, M. R.				journal of asthma and allergy	journal of asthma and allergy	OBJECTIVES: Randomized clinical trial (RCT) data reviewed for outcomes and processes associated with asthma educational and behavioral interventions provided by different types of health professionals. METHODS: Cochrane Collaboration, MEDLINE, PUBMED, Google Scholar search from 1998 to 2009 identified 1650 articles regarding asthma educational and behavioral interventions resulting in 249 potential studies and following assessment produced a final sample of 50 RCTs. RESULTS: Approaches, intended outcomes, and program providers vary greatly. No rationale provided in study reports for the selection of specific outcomes, program providers, or program components. Health care utilization and symptom control have been the most common outcomes assessed. Specific providers favor particular teaching approaches. Multidisciplinary teams have been the most frequent providers of asthma interventions. Physician-led interventions were most successful for outcomes related to the use of health care. Multidisciplinary teams were best in achieving symptom reduction and quality of life. Lay persons were best in achieving self-management/self-efficacy outcomes. Components most frequently employed in successful programs are skills to improve patient-clinician communication and education to enhance patient self-management. Fifty percent of interventions achieved reduction in the use of health care and one-third in symptom control. A combination approach including self-management and patient-clinician communication involving multidisciplinary team members may have the greatest effect on most outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The extent to which and how different providers achieve asthma outcomes through educational and behavioral interventions is emerging from recent studies. Health care use and symptom control are evolving as the gold standard for intervention outcomes. Development of self-management and clinician-patient communication skills are program components associated with success across outcomes and providers.			2010				151
The Use of a Membrane and/or a Bone Graft may not Improve the Effects of Enamel Matrix Derivatives in Infrabony Defects		Verardi, S.				the journal of evidence-based dental practice	the journal of evidence-based dental practice	Summary: Selection Criteria: This study undertook a network meta-analyses of studies comparing the effect of enamel matrix derivatives when used alone or in combination with bone grafts and/or membranes in the treatment of infrabony periodontal defects. A literature search was conducted on several medical databases (Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, and CENTRAL) and also on regular Web search engines (Google). Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review. For study inclusion, the patients (or the periodontal defects) had to be randomly assigned to the test or control group and there had to have been follow-up for a minimum of 6 months. Key Study Factor: Treatment of infrabony defects with emdogain alone and with emdogain plus membrane and/or bone graft. Main Outcome Measure: The primary outcomes were reduction in pocket probing depth (PD), gain of clinical attachment level (CAL), and infrabony defect depth recorded at least 6 months after the procedure was completed. Main Results: Twenty-eight publications were included in this systematic review with meta-analysis. In the initial search, 337 articles were found: 35 articles were found on medical databases (PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Central); 1 article was found through the gray search (Google); and 1 article was found through the electronic search in 3 periodontal journals. Of the 337 articles, 306 were excluded at the assessment of titles and abstracts phase because they were either case reports or they were not considered RCTs. The remaining 31 articles were examined in their full length (not just abstracts and titles). Three of these articles were excluded because they were not RCTs or because the adjunctive treatment was not considered regenerative. Because many variations of the treatment were used in the selected studies, the authors used network meta-analysis for the statistical synthesis of direct and indirect comparisons. Enamel matrix derivatives (EMDs) plus bone grafts and EMDs plus membranes attained 0.24 mm and 0.07 mm more PPD reduction than EMDs alone, respectively. For CAL gain, EMDs plus bone grafts and EMDs plus membranes attained 0.46 mm and 0.15 mm, respectively. Conclusions: The analysis shows that adding membranes and/or bone grafts to the EMDs does not provide significant benefits in the treatment of periodontal defects			2010				854
Is guided self-help as effective as face-to-face psychotherapy for depression and anxiety disorders? A systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative outcome studies		Cuijpers, P., Donker, T., van Straten, A., Li, J. and Andersson, G.				psychological medicine	psychological medicine	BACKGROUND: Although guided self-help for depression and anxiety disorders has been examined in many studies, it is not clear whether it is equally effective as face-to-face treatments.MethodWe conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in which the effects of guided self-help on depression and anxiety were compared directly with face-to-face psychotherapies for depression and anxiety disorders. A systematic search in bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane) resulted in 21 studies with 810 participants. RESULTS: The overall effect size indicating the difference between guided self-help and face-to-face psychotherapy at post-test was d=-0.02, in favour of guided self-help. At follow-up (up to 1 year) no significant difference was found either. No significant difference was found between the drop-out rates in the two treatments formats. CONCLUSIONS: It seems safe to conclude that guided self-help and face-to-face treatments can have comparable effects. It is time to start thinking about implementation in routine care.			2010				165
Effects of ingesting protein in combination with carbohydrate during exercise on endurance performance: a systematic review with meta-analysis		Stearns, R. L., Emmanuel, H., Volek, J. S. and Casa, D. J.				journal of strength and conditioning research / national strength & conditioning association	journal of strength and conditioning research / national strength & conditioning association	Coingestion of protein with carbohydrate has been shown to enhance muscle recovery, particularly after intense bouts of exercise. However, performance benefits of ingesting a protein-carbohydrate drink during exercise remains unclear. Therefore, we used a systematic review with meta-analysis to examine the influence of protein ingestion during exercise on subsequent endurance performance. Eleven qualifying studies were included that contained 3 time-trial and 8 time-to-exhaustion cycling protocols. Only 3 of these studies controlled for caloric content and contained an isocaloric trial. Of the 11, 4 reported significant differences between a control and protein trial; however, none of these were isocaloric studies. The 3 time-trial protocols showed no significant improvement with protein. The meta-analysis of the time-trial studies revealed no significant overall effect (p = 0.73), whereas meta-analysis of time-to-exhaustion studies revealed a significant effect (p = 0.008). Of the time-to-exhaustion trials, the isocaloric studies found no significant effect (p = 0.71), whereas the isocarbohydrate studies revealed a significant effect (p = 0.05). The average percent improvement with ingestion of protein was 9.0%. The isocarbohydrate studies reported an improvement of 10.5%, whereas the isocaloric studies revealed a 3.4% improvement. We conclude that compared to carbohydrate alone, coingestion of protein and carbohydrate during exercise demonstrated an ergogenic effect on endurance performance when assessed by time to exhaustion and also where supplements were matched for carbohydrate (isocarbohydrate). Thus, the ergogenic effect of protein seen in isocarbohydrate studies may be because of a generic effect of adding calories (fuel) as opposed to a unique benefit of protein. Further research is warranted before a clear conclusion can be drawn.			2010				787
Abnormal breath testing in IBS: a meta-analysis		Shah, E. D., Basseri, R. J., Chong, K. and Pimentel, M.				digestive diseases and sciences	digestive diseases and sciences	BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests a role for enteric bacteria in the development of symptoms in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The concept was initially based on the common finding of an abnormal lactulose breath test to suggest the presence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Despite successful antibiotic studies based on these findings, the premise of bacterial overgrowth was met with skepticism due to the perceived inaccuracies of breath testing in humans. In this study, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the studies using breath testing in IBS subjects with comparison to healthy controls. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify studies in which breath testing was conducted in subjects with IBS. Once abstract titles were identified, studies that examined breath testing in a case-control fashion were identified for paper review. After exclusion criteria were applied, the remaining papers were examined using meta-analysis, among which the prevalence of an abnormal breath test in IBS subjects was compared. Further analysis was conducted among studies with appropriate age- and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: Eleven studies met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Although heterogeneity was identified among studies on the basis of substrate used, lactulose was the most common substrate. In pooling the 11 studies, breath testing was more often abnormal among IBS subjects than health controls (OR=4.46, 95% CI=1.69-11.80). This was further evident in more appropriately designed age- and sex-matched studies (OR=9.64, 95% CI=4.26-21.82). The overall sensitivity and specificity for breath testing in separating IBS from healthy controls was 43.6 and 83.6%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the breath test findings in IBS appear to be valid. While this meta-analysis does not suggest that the breath test findings imply SIBO, the abnormal fermentation timing and dynamics of the breath test findings support a role for abnormal intestinal bacterial distribution in IBS.			2010				737
Patient outcome in migraine prophylaxis: the role of psychopharmacological agents		Pompili, M., Serafini, G., Innamorati, M., Serra, G., Dominici, G., Fortes-Lindau, J., Pastina, M., Telesforo, L., Lester, D., Girardi, P., Tatarelli, R. and Martelletti, P.				patient related outcome measures	patient related outcome measures	"INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a serious illness that needs correct treatment for acute attacks and, in addition, a treatment prophylaxis, since patients with migraine suffer during acute attacks and also between attacks. METHODS: A systematic review of the most relevant clinical trials of migraine headache and its epidemiology, pathophysiology, comorbidity, and prophylactic treatment (medical and nonmedical) was carried out using ""Medline"" and ""PsychINFO"" from 1973 to 2009. Approximately 110 trials met our inclusion criteria and were included in the current review. RESULTS: The most effective pharmacological treatment for migraine prophylaxis is propranolol and anticonvulsants such as topiramate, valproic acid, and amitriptyline. Nonmedical treatments such as acupuncture, biofeedback, and melatonin have also been proposed. Peripheral neurostimulation has been suggested for the treatment of chronic daily headache that does not respond to prophylaxis and for the treatment of drug-resistant primary headache. The majority of the pharmacological agents available today have limited efficacy and may cause adverse effects incompatible with long-term use. LIMITATIONS: The review was limited by the highly variable and often insufficient reporting of the complex outcome data and by the fact that migraine prophylaxis trials typically use headache diaries to monitor the course of the disease. The results of the different studies were also presented in different ways, making comparison of the results difficult. DISCUSSION: An adequate prophylaxis is crucial in reducing disability and preventing the evolution of the problem into a chronic progressive illness. The implications of the present findings were discussed."			2010				659
Stereotactic radiotherapy for pulmonary oligometastases: a systematic review		Siva, S., MacManus, M. and Ball, D.				journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the international association for the study of lung cancer	journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the international association for the study of lung cancer	INTRODUCTION: Hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an emerging noninvasive technique for the treatment of oligometastatic cancer. The use of small numbers of large doses, should in theory, achieve high rates of local control. The aim of this literature review is to critically assess the use of SBRT for the treatment of pulmonary metastases as judged by its effect on local control, survival, and toxicity. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed. Both single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and hypofractionated radiotherapy (SBRT) were considered individually. Thirteen institutions reported results regarding SBRT and seven institutions regarding SRS (a total of 29 publications). Outcomes, techniques, radiobiology, and the scientific rigor of the reported studies were analyzed. RESULTS: A wide range of techniques, doses, and dose fractionation schedules were found. Three hundred thirty-four patients with 564 targets were reported in the SBRT series. The 2-year weighted local control was 77.9%. The corresponding 2-year weighted overall survival was 53.7%, with a 4% rate of grade 3 or higher radiation toxicities. One hundred fifty-four patients with 174 targets were treated in the SRS series. The 2-year weighted local control was 78.6%. The corresponding weighted 2-year overall survival was 50.3%, with 2.6% rate of grade 3 or higher toxicities. CONCLUSION: There was insufficient evidence to recommend a consensus view for optimal tumor parameters, dose fractionation, and technical delivery of treatment. This indicates the need for further prospective studies. However, high local control rates that could potentially lead to a survival benefit justifies the consideration of stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with limited pulmonary oligometastases.			2010				759
Reduction of Family Violence in Aboriginal Communities: A Systematic Review of Interventions and Approaches		Shea, B., Nahwegahbow, A. and Andersson, N.				pimatisiwin	pimatisiwin	Many efforts to reduce family violence are documented in the published literature. We conducted a systematic review of interventions intended to prevent family violence in Aboriginal communities. We retrieved studies published up to October 2009; 506 papers included one systematic review, two randomized controlled trials, and fourteen nonrandomized studies or reviews. Two reviews discussed interventions relevant to primary prevention (reducing the risk factors for family violence), including parenting, role modelling, and active participation. More studies addressed secondary prevention (where risk factors exist, reducing outbreaks of violence) such as restriction on the trading hours for take away alcohol and home visiting programs for high risk families. Examples of tertiary prevention (preventing recurrence) include traditional healing circles and group counselling. Most studies contributed a low level of evidence.			2010				744
Review of intrauterine adhesions		Deans, R. and Abbott, J.				journal of minimally invasive gynecology	journal of minimally invasive gynecology	"This article has been produced to review the literature on symptomatic and asymptomatic intrauterine adhesions. Electronic resources including Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), Current Contents, and EMBASE were searched using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), including all subheadings, and the keywords ""Asherman syndrome,"" ""Hysteroscopic lysis of adhesions,"" ""Hysteroscopic synechiolysis,"" ""Hysteroscopy and adhesion,"" ""Intrauterine adhesions,"" ""Intrauterine septum and synechiae,"" and ""Obstetric outcomes after intrauterine surgery."" The vast majority of evidence in the literature consists of uncontrolled case series, with only intrauterine adhesion barriers being assessed in a randomized controlled format. This article reviews epidemiology, pathologic features, classification systems, and treatments. Seven classification systems are described, with no universal acceptance of any one system and no validation of any of them. Hysteroscopy is the mainstay of both diagnosis and treatment, with medical treatments having no role in management. There is a wide range of treatment techniques with no controlled comparative studies, and assessments are descriptive and report fertility and menstrual outcomes, with more severe adhesions having the worst clinical outcomes. One of the most important features of treatment is prevention of recurrence, with the best available evidence demonstrating that newly developed adhesion barriers such as hyaluronic acid show promise for preventing new adhesions."			2010				189
Rectum-conserving surgery in the era of chemoradiotherapy		Smith, F. M., Waldron, D. and Winter, D. C.				the british journal of surgery	the british journal of surgery	BACKGROUND: A complete pathological response occurs in 10-30 per cent of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The standard of care has been radical surgery with high morbidity risks and the challenges of stomata despite the favourable prognosis. This review assessed minimalist approaches (transanal excision or observation alone) to tumours with a response to CRT. METHODS: A systematic review was performed using PubMed and Embase databases. Keywords included: 'rectal', 'cancer', 'transanal', 'conservative', 'complete pathological response', 'radiotherapy' and 'neoadjuvant'. Original articles from all relevant listings were sourced. These were hand searched for further articles of relevance. Main outcome measures assessed were rates of local recurrence and overall survival, and equivalence to radical surgery. RESULTS: Purely conservative 'watch and wait' strategies after CRT are still controversial. Originally used for elderly patients or those who refused surgery, the data support transanal excision of rectal tumours showing a good response to CRT. A complete pathological response in the T stage (ypT0) indicates < 5 per cent risk of nodal metastases. CONCLUSION: Rectal tumours showing an excellent response to CRT may be suitable for local excision, with equivalent outcomes to radical surgery. This approach should be the subject of prospective clinical trials in specialist centres.			2010				764
[Non-infectious pulmonary complications after the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]		Mancuzo, E. V., Neves, M. A., Bittencourt, H. and de Rezende, N. A.				revista portuguesa de pneumologia	revista portuguesa de pneumologia	Pulmonary complications are important cause of mortality and morbidity after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in 30% to 60% of the patients. Improvements in prophylaxis and treatment of infectious complications have been increasing the rate of non-infectious complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of those complications can significantly change the evolution of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation receptors. The objective of this study is to review the most frequent non-infection complications associated to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation since the first bone marrow transplantation performed in 1957. A systematic literature review was performed, using the PICO strategy to ask the questions. The descriptors hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, non-infectious pulmonary complications, systematic review, in portuguese and their english correspondents, were used to access the following databases: MEDLINE, EBM, Embase, Cocrane Library, LILACS and SciELO. In this review, 263 studies were identified, from which 31 were selected for full analyzis. The non-infection pulmonary complications most frequently found were: bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, pulmonary edema, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, delayed pulmonary toxicity syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, engrafment syndrome and pulmonary cytolitic thrombi.			2010				499
Effectiveness of interventions designed to promote patient involvement to enhance safety: a systematic review		Hall, J., Peat, M., Birks, Y., Golder, S., Group, Pips, Entwistle, V., Gilbody, S., Mansell, P., McCaughan, D., Sheldon, T., Watt, I., Williams, B. and Wright, J.				quality & safety in health care	quality & safety in health care	BACKGROUND: There is growing international interest in involving patients in interventions to promote and support them in securing their own safety. This paper reports a systematic review of evaluations of the effectiveness of interventions that have been used with the explicit intention of promoting patient involvement in patient safety in healthcare. METHODS: The authors searched Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, HMIC, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in-process, PsycINFO and ASSIA to August 2008. We also searched databases of reports, conference proceedings, grey literature, ongoing research and relevant patient safety organisations, and hand-searched two journals. Meta-analysis of the data was not appropriate; therefore, studies were categorised according to how the interventions encouraged patients' actions to improve safety--informing the management plan, monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment (by health professional and by self), making systems safer--and were critiqued in a narrative manner. FINDINGS: The authors identified 14 individual experimental and quasiexperimental studies plus one systematic review. The majority of studies fell into the monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment by self category and were all related to enhancing medication safety. Authors reported improved patient safety incident outcomes for the intervention groups compared with controls where the interventions aimed to encourage patient involvement in: (1) monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment by self (self-management of anticoagulation, 'easy' read information leaflet, nurse-led education to promote self-medication in hospital, patient package insert using lay terminology); (2) informing the management plan/monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment by self (individualised teaching plan by nurse, pharmacist counselling). It was not possible to draw any clear conclusions as to the effectiveness of the interventions (with the exception of one specific aspect of self-medication, that is, self-management of anticoagulation) due to concerns about the methodological quality of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote patient involvement on patient safety incidents and in general is poor quality. Existing evidence is confined to the promotion of safe self-management of medication, most notably relating to the self-management of oral anticoagulants.			2010				298
Alternate-day statin therapy for the treatment of hyperlipidemia		Reindl, E. K., Wright, B. M. and Wargo, K. A.				the annals of pharmacotherapy	the annals of pharmacotherapy	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and cost of alternate-day statin therapy in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches were conducted for primary literature sources involving alternative statin regimens using PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (January 1966-March 2010). Articles selected were limited to those published in the English language. Reference citations from relevant publications identified were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language articles identified were reviewed and 17 trials (14 prospective and 3 retrospective) involving alternate-day statin dosing were included. Studies involving alternative statin dosing regimens other than alternating days were excluded from this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Daily administration of statins is the standard of therapy used to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels as well as atherosclerosis that may lead to coronary events. Through LDL-C lowering and pleiotropic effects, statins decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, due to cost and adverse effects of statins, some patients are nonadherent to statin therapy. Several small studies have found alternate-day statin therapy to be as effective at reducing LDL-C as daily administration, while also lowering the incidence of adverse reactions and potentially lowering cost. CONCLUSIONS: Alternate-day statin therapy may decrease cost and therapy-limiting adverse reactions while potentially increasing regimen adherence and positively affecting the lipid panel. Further research is needed to determine whether this alternative regimen produces similar cardiovascular outcomes as those with daily statin therapy.			2010				684
[Systematic review about eccentric training in chronic achilles tendinopathy]		Krämer, R., Lorenzen, J., Vogt, P. M. and Knobloch, K.				sportverletzung sportschaden : organ der gesellschaft für orthopädisch-traumatologische sportmedizin	sportverletzung sportschaden : organ der gesellschaft für orthopädisch-traumatologische sportmedizin	BACKGROUND: Throughout the recent decade, eccentric training has become a widely accepted therapy option in the conservative treatment of chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Nevertheless, current recommendations are missing regarding dosage and duration of eccentric training as well as standardized training protocols. OBJECTIVES: Is eccentric training as a conservative treatment in chronic Achilles tendinopathy of beneficial effect versus other conservative treatments? According to the current scientific data, is it possible to recommend dosages and duration of training time of eccentric training? STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of the current scientific literature on eccentric training as a conservative treatment in chronic Achilles tendinopathy according to the PRISMA-guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). DATA SOURCE: National library of Medicine (NLM) between the years 1950 and 2010. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Prospective randomised controlled trials (RCT). PARTICIPANTS: 8 RCTs included 416 subjects with a median number of 42 subjects and a range of 17 to 116 subjects per trial. Median follow-up duration was 12 weeks with a range from 12 to 54 weeks. RESULTS: 124 papers met the eligibility criteria in the NLM, whereas only eight randomised controlled trials were included in this review after screening titles, abstracts and full texts. All included trials demonstrated an improvement in pain after performing equivalent training protocols of eccentric training in chronic Achilles tendinopathy. LIMITATIONS: A pooled statistical evaluation of the included trials could not be performed due to different study designs as well as limited documentation of subjects' compliance. CONCLUSION: In spite of different compliance, effects of eccentric training in conservative treatment of chronic mid-portion-Achilles tendinopathy are promising. Because of the heterogeneous outcome variables (ordinal scale, VAS, FAOS, AOFAS, VISA-A) and the methodological limitations of the trials, no definite recommendation can be published concerning dosage and duration of eccentric training in chronic Achilles tendinopathy.			2010				419
Isoflavones versus hormone therapy for reduction of vertebral fracture risk: indirect comparison		Bolaños, R. and Francia, J.				menopause (new york, n.y.)	menopause (new york, n.y.)	OBJECTIVE:: The aim of this study was to conduct an indirect comparison of the results from meta-analyses that evaluated the incidence of osteoporotic vertebral fracture in postmenopausal women exposed to hormone therapy (HT) or isoflavones. METHODS:: Systematic review and meta-analysis of HT and isoflavones related to the reduction of vertebral fracture risk in osteoporotic women versus the same control (placebo) were undertaken. Then, the combination of the overall results obtained from these two meta-analysis (indirect comparison) was adjusted to the common control (placebo). RESULTS:: The indirect odds ratio (OR), obtained from the combination of both individual meta-analyses, was calculated by using the following equation: OR(indirect) = OR(HT)/OR(isoflav), with a total indirect variance equivalent to the following equation: var(total) = var(HT) + var(isoflav). These calculations yielded a point estimate of 1.56 (95% CI, 0.39-6.19) for the indirect OR. CONCLUSIONS:: According to this indirect comparison, there is no statistically significant difference between HT or isoflavones in the reduction of vertebral fracture risk due to osteoporosis, and both interventions seem to be similar for this outcome.			2010				84
Effect of body cooling on subsequent aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance: a systematic review		Ranalli, G. F., Demartini, J. K., Casa, D. J., McDermott, B. P., Armstrong, L. E. and Maresh, C. M.				journal of strength and conditioning research / national strength & conditioning association	journal of strength and conditioning research / national strength & conditioning association	Body cooling has become common in athletics, with numerous studies looking at different cooling modalities and different types of exercise. A search of the literature revealed 14 studies that measured performance following cooling intervention and had acceptable protocols for exercise and performance measures. These studies were objectively analyzed with the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale, and 13 of the studies were included in this review. These studies revealed that body cooling by various modalities had consistent and greater impact on aerobic exercise performance (mean increase in performance = 4.25%) compared to anaerobic (mean increase in performance = 0.66%). Different cooling modalities, and cooling during different points during an exercise protocol, had extremely varied results. In conclusion, body cooling seems to have a positive effect on aerobic performance, although the impact on anaerobic performance may vary and often does not provide the same positive effect.			2010				678
Thickened fluids for people with dementia in residential aged care facilities		Hines, S., McCrow, J., Abbey, J. and Gledhill, S.				international journal of evidence-based healthcare	international journal of evidence-based healthcare	AIM: This systematic review aimed to establish best practice in relation to thickened fluids for people with dementia living in residential aged care facilities. METHODS: This review considered all types of studies that examined the prescription and administration of thickened fluids to people with dementia in residential aged care facilities. English-language articles published from 1995 to 2008 were sought in a comprehensive search of an extensive range of databases, online sources and unpublished literature. Two independent reviewers critically appraised each article using the relevant Joanna Briggs Institute System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information (JBI-SUMARI) instruments, then data were extracted from those articles that met the inclusion criteria. No meta-analysis was possible because of significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity, therefore results are reported narratively. RESULTS: From 112 papers originally identified, 14 met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis of the findings. Nine studies recommend the use of thickened fluids as a strategy to maintain adequate fluid intake for persons with dementia with dysphagia in residential aged care and four papers recommend their use for people with dementia in general. One paper reported that the use of thickened fluids was found to be acceptable to older people in the event of dementia and dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS: From the retrieved data, evidence-based best practices cannot be concluded. It can, however, be cautiously inferred that thickened fluids may be effective for residents with dementia if set guidelines are instituted.			2010				321
Evidence-based treatment of maisonneuve fractures		Stufkens, S. A., van den Bekerom, M. P., Doornberg, J. N., van Dijk, C. N. and Kloen, P.				the journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the american college of foot and ankle surgeons	the journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the american college of foot and ankle surgeons	The objective of the current study was to review the published clinical evidence available for the treatment of Maisonneuve fractures. Medline via PubMed, Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) annual meetings' abstracts archives Web site, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Clinical Trial register were searched for the period extending from January 1970 to May 2009 in order to identify studies relating to the treatment of Maisonneuve ankle fractures. Six level 4 (case series, N ? 5) studies, describing a total of 83 patients with a Maisonneuve fracture, were included in the review. Although the authors did not compare the different treatment strategies described in the reports, the overall outcomes were generally good, and included 74 (89%) patients in which the outcome was considered good or excellent, and 9 (11%) patients in which the outcome was considered fair or poor. Based on this review, some grade B and C recommendations for the treatment of Maisonneuve fractures were formulated, including: 1) the medial malleolus should be fixated, 2) the torn deltoid ligament need not be directly repaired, 3) syndesmotic instability can be treated with one or two 3- or 4-cortical screws and these can be placed percutaneously, and 4) the proximal fibular fracture does not require direct internal fixation. Recommendations for future research were also formulated and described in this report.			2011				2145
Educational interventions for implementation of arthritis clinical practice guidelines in primary care: effects on health professional behavior		Lineker, S. C. and Husted, J. A.				the journal of rheumatology	the journal of rheumatology	OBJECTIVE: The dissemination and adoption of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) has been suggested as one method for improving arthritis care delivery. This article provides a review and synthesis of studies evaluating the influence of educational programs designed to implement CPG for osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in primary care. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant educational interventions that reported behavioral outcomes that ensured actual knowledge utilization in primary care. A standardized approach was used to assess the quality of the individual studies and a modified version of the Philadelphia Panel methodology allowed for grading of studies based on strength of design, clinical relevance, and statistical significance. RESULTS: The search identified 485 articles; 7 studies were selected for review. In OA, peer facilitated workshops with nurse case-management support for patients decreased the number of referrals to orthopedics by 23%, and educational outreach by trained physicians improved prescribing of analgesics. Interprofessional peer facilitated workshops were successful in increasing referrals to rehabilitation services for people with OA and RA. CONCLUSION: There was sparse literature on educational programs for the implementation of arthritis CPG in the primary care environment. Future studies are needed to evaluate which specific organizational, provider, patient, and system level factors influence the uptake of arthritis CPG in primary care.			2010				468
Is there a link between seropositivity to Helicobacter pylori and hepatitis A virus? A systematic review		BinSaeed, A. A.				international journal of infectious diseases : ijid : official publication of the international society for infectious diseases	international journal of infectious diseases : ijid : official publication of the international society for infectious diseases	BACKGROUND: Since hepatitis A virus (HAV) is acquired primarily through the fecal-oral pathway, several investigators have used HAV seropositivity as a proxy for exposure to this pathway. This paper is a critical review of the evidence relevant to the association between seropositivity to HAV and Helicobacter pylori, and considers the validity of comparisons for testing the hypothesis that H. pylori spreads by the fecal-oral route. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Medline search identified reports of all types published in the English language literature that were linked to the keywords 'Campylobacter pylori', 'hepatitis A', or 'Helicobacter pylori', cross-referenced with 'seroepidemiology', 'seroprevalence', or 'seropositivity'. Studies identified by the search were included in the review if they used specific IgG antibodies to classify the serostatus of subjects for both HAV and H. pylori infection and provided an estimate of the magnitude of the association between HAV and H. pylori or information that permitted calculation of an odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: Out of the 21 studies identified, 15 met the inclusion criteria. The studies showed ORs for an association of HAV and H. pylori that ranged from 0.81 to 8.4. After adjustment for potential confounders, ORs shifted toward the null. They also showed that HAV seroprevalence is lower than H. pylori seroprevalence in early life and then becomes higher in later life. Thus in most populations, the trends cross over at some point. CONCLUSION: The observed associations between the two infections are generally overestimated by the confounding effects of age and socio-economic status-related factors, and when these factors are controlled, the association becomes weak. Moreover, HAV infection elicits a long-term antibody response, while H. pylori infection does not. Consequently, serostatus comparison does not constitute a convincing test of the fecal-oral transmission hypothesis for H. pylori.			2010				76
Resistance exercise for muscular strength in older adults: a meta-analysis		Peterson, M. D., Rhea, M. R., Sen, A. and Gordon, P. M.				ageing research reviews	ageing research reviews	PURPOSE: The effectiveness of resistance exercise for strength improvement among aging persons is inconsistent across investigations, and there is a lack of research synthesis for multiple strength outcomes. METHODS: The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect of resistance exercise (RE) for multiple strength outcomes in aging adults. Randomized-controlled trials and randomized or non-randomized studies among adults > or = 50 years, were included. Data were pooled using random-effect models. Outcomes for 4 common strength tests were analyzed for main effects. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Cochran Q and I(2) statistics, and publication bias was evaluated through physical inspection of funnel plots as well as formal rank-correlation statistics. A linear mixed model regression was incorporated to examine differences between outcomes, as well as potential study-level predictor variables. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were included, representing 1079 participants. A positive effect for each of the strength outcomes was determined however there was heterogeneity between studies. Regression revealed that higher intensity training was associated with greater improvement. Strength increases ranged from 9.8 to 31.6 kg, and percent changes were 29+/-2, 24+/-2, 33+/-3, and 25+/-2, respectively for leg press, chest press, knee extension, and lat pull. CONCLUSIONS: RE is effective for improving strength among older adults, particularly with higher intensity training. Findings therefore suggest that RE may be considered a viable strategy to prevent generalized muscular weakness associated with aging.			2010				649
Linezolid treatment of nosocomial bacterial infection with multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens in preterm infants: a systematic review		Kocher, S., Müller, W. and Resch, B.				international journal of antimicrobial agents	international journal of antimicrobial agents	Linezolid is an antibiotic of the oxazolidinone class that has bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against a broad range of Gram-positive bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens. Owing to increasing resistance of Gram-positive pathogens to traditional antibiotics such as vancomycin, the oxazolidinones were introduced into therapy. The aim of this review was to summarise actual data on the pharmacokinetics, safety and clinical use of linezolid in preterm infants. The Medline and EMBASE databases were searched using the term 'linezolid' combined with 'newborn', 'neonate', 'preterm' and 'premature' for papers published between January 1987 and June 2009. Studies reporting on a population including preterm infants and other age groups as well as case reports on preterm infants only were acceptable for analysis. Five studies and eight case reports were identified evaluating linezolid in preterm infants. A dosage regimen of 10mg/kg body weight given either orally or intravenously every 8h in infants aged >or=1 week and the same dose given every 12h in infants <1 week was shown to be safe and effective with a mean treatment duration of 10-28 days. In summary, linezolid was shown to be a safe and effective alternative to vancomycin in the treatment of infections with multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens in preterm infants.			2010				411
The clinical effectiveness of chokeberry: a systematic review		Chrubasik, C., Li, G. and Chrubasik, S.				phytotherapy research : ptr	phytotherapy research : ptr	Products derived from the black chokeberry, Aronia melanocarpa, are claimed to be beneficial in disorders or diseases associated with oxidative stress. The claims are based on evidence from in vitro studies and animal experiments. The active principle - a mixture of procyanidins, anthocyanins and phenolic acids - constitutes one of the most potent natural antioxidants. A systematic review was carried out of the quality of the clinical trials on chokeberry products that had been published up to December 2009, and conventionally established criteria were used to assess the strength of the evidence for their clinical effectiveness. Thirteen studies were identified. The quality of most of the trials and, correspondingly, the evidence of effectiveness for Aronia products is poor. Though laboratory and clinical data indicate that chokeberry products may well be useful as 'functional food' for disorders or diseases related to oxidative stress, these promising indications need to be confirmed in more rigorous studies before putative therapeutic uses can be confidently recommended for chokeberry products.

Rehabilitation in spine and spinal cord trauma		Labruyère, R., Agarwala, A. and Curt, A.				spine	spine	STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To define the optimal time for initiation of rehabilitation and review the most clinically relevant outcome measures of upper and lower limb motor function of the rehabilitating spinal cord injured patient, using a systematic review and expert opinion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Comprehensive rehabilitation programs are required for patients after spinal cord injury (SCI) as early as feasible. In a dedicated SCI rehabilitation setting, effective treatment and proper monitoring of spontaneous and rehabilitation-based motor function improvements by means of appropriate, valid, reliable and internationally accepted clinical assessment tools is warranted. METHODS: Focused questions on key topics in rehabilitation of the spinal cord injured patient were defined by a panel of spine trauma surgeons. A keyword literature search for pertinent articles was conducted using multiple databases. Suitable articles were screened and the quality of evidence was graded and tabulated. Based on the evidence and expert opinion, recommendations were composed and rated as strong or weak. RESULTS: The outcome measures literature search yielded a total of 1251 abstracts. Out of these 86 articles were studied in detail. One high quality study was found with 3 articles referring to it. Furthermore, there were 19 moderate quality studies, 39 low quality studies, and 25 very low quality studies. The timing literature search yielded 508 abstracts of which 3 articles focused on the question and were all graded as low quality. CONCLUSION: For general motor function, assessing the American Spinal Injury Association motor score and the Spinal Cord Independence Measure III is strongly recommended. The American Spinal Injury Association motor score is also useful in assessing upper- and lower-extremity motor function. For ambulatory function, a timed walk test like the 10 m Walk test in combination with the Walking Index for SCI II is strongly recommended. Early rehabilitation, defined as within 30 days of injury, improves outcome and recovery for spinal cord trauma patients.			2010				434
Metastatic spinal cord compression: a review of practice and care		Kilbride, L., Cox, M., Kennedy, C. M., Lee, S. H. and Grant, R.				journal of clinical nursing	journal of clinical nursing	AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to address: (1) How is spinal stability assessed? (2) What is the role of bracing/should braces be used? (3) When is it safe to mobilise the patient? (4) What position should the patient be nursed in? BACKGROUND: Controversy surrounds the care for patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC). There is some evidence to indicate that care for patients with MSCC is based on individual clinician preference rather than evidence-based guidelines which has been shown to cause delays and discrepancies in patient treatment. DESIGN: A structured literature review to synthesise the available evidence about the management of MSCC. METHODS: The following databases were searched: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Systematic Reviews Database, SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network), NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) and BNI (British Nursing Index). Publications were selected from the past 10 years. The search yielded a total of 1057 hits, 755 abstracts were screened, and 73 articles were retrieved and examined. Thirty-five articles were included. RESULTS: The findings identified a gap and evidence relating to spinal stability, bracing, patient mobilisation, and positioning is limited and may be inconclusive. It is important for patients with a poor prognosis that their preferences and quality of life are considered. CONCLUSION: Currently, the evidence base to underpin care is limited, and further research in this area is necessary for patients and healthcare professionals alike. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Patients who suffer from MSCC suffer numerous physical, psychological and social issues. Because of lack of consensus, the current guidelines to inform clinical decision-making of professional staff are of limited benefit.			2010				402
Provision of DMPA by community health workers: what the evidence shows		Malarcher, S., Meirik, O., Lebetkin, E., Shah, I., Spieler, J. and Stanback, J.				contraception	contraception	BACKGROUND: To reduce a large unmet need for family planning in many developing countries, governments are increasingly looking to community health workers (CHWs) as an effective service delivery option for health care and as a feasible option to increase access to family planning services. This article synthesizes evidence on the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of community-based delivery of the injectable contraceptive depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). STUDY DESIGN: Manual and electronic search and systematic review of published and unpublished documents on delivery of contraceptive injectables by CHWs. RESULTS: Of 600 identified documents, 19 had adequate information on injectables, almost exclusively intramuscular DMPA, provided by CHWs. The data showed that appropriately trained CHW demonstrate competency in screening clients, providing DMPA injections safely and counseling on side effects, although counseling appears equally suboptimal in both clinic and community settings. Clients and CHWs report high rates of satisfaction with community-based provision of DMPA. Provision of DMPA in community-based programs using CHWs expanded access to underserved clients and led to increased uptake of family planning services. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that DMPA can be provided safely by appropriately trained and supervised CHWs. The benefits of community-based provision of DMPA by CHWs outweigh any potential risks, and past experiences support increasing investments in and expansion of these programs.			2011				2364
Adverse events of moxibustion: A systematic review		Park, J. E., Lee, S. S., Lee, M. S., Choi, S. M. and Ernst, E.				complementary therapies in medicine	complementary therapies in medicine	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to identify adverse events of moxibustion as reported in the medical literature. METHODS: Computerised literature searches were carried out in 14 databases. All articles reporting adverse effects of any type from moxibustion in humans were included, regardless of study design and publication language. The related journals and references in all located articles were manually searched for further relevant articles. Data were extracted and evaluated according to predefined criteria by three independent reviewers. RESULTS: Adverse events related to moxibustion treatment were reported in 4 randomised clinical trials, 1 controlled clinical trial, 2 uncontrolled observational studies, 13 case reports, and 1 prospective study. The most common effects identified in this review were allergic reactions, burns, and infections such as cellulitis and hepatitis C. Allergic reactions were reported in six case reports (four case reports related to infections and two related to burns). The other articles were case reports of xerophthalmia, xeroderma, hyperpigmented macules, ptosis and eversion of the eyelids. In clinical trials, various adverse events such as rubefaction, blistering, itching sensations, discomfort due to smoke, general fatigue, stomach upsets, flare-ups, headaches, and burns were reported. Tenderness and pressure in the epigastric region or in one of the hypochondriac regions, unpleasant odour with or without nausea and throat problems, abdominal pain, premature birth, premature rupture of the membrane and bleeding due to excess pressure on the anterior placenta were reported in pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Moxibustion is not entirely risk free, as it has several kinds of potential adverse events such as allergy, burn and infection. Currently, the incidence of such events is not known. In the interest of patient safety, sufficiently large prospective studies should be considered to clarify this issue.			2010				630
Stress ulcer prophylaxis in the new millennium: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Marik, P. E., Vasu, T., Hirani, A. and Pachinburavan, M.				critical care medicine	critical care medicine	BACKGROUND:: Recent observational studies suggest that bleeding from stress ulceration is extremely uncommon in intensive care unit patients. Furthermore, the risk of bleeding may not be altered by the use of acid suppressive therapy. Early enteral tube feeding (initiated within 48 hrs of intensive care unit admission) may account for this observation. Stress ulcer prophylaxis may, however, increase the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia and Clostridia difficile infection. OBJECTIVE:: A systematic review of the literature to determine the benefit and risks of stress ulcer prophylaxis and the moderating effect of enteral nutrition. DATA SOURCES:: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles. STUDY SELECTION:: Randomized, controlled studies that evaluated the association between stress ulcer prophylaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding. We included only those studies that compared a histamine-2 receptor blocker with a placebo. DATA EXTRACTION:: Data were abstracted on study design, study size, study setting, patient population, the histamine-2 receptor blocker and dosage used, the incidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding, hospital-acquired pneumonia, mortality, and the use of enteral nutrition. DATA SYNTHESIS:: Seventeen studies (which enrolled 1836 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Patients received adequate enteral nutrition in three of the studies. Overall, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a histamine-2 receptor blocker reduced the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (odds ratio 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.76; p < .002; I = 44%); however, the treatment effect was noted only in the subgroup of patients who did not receive enteral nutrition. In those patients who were fed enterally, stress ulcer prophylaxis did not alter the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (odds ratio 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-3.7). Overall histamine-2 receptor blockers did not increase the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (odds ratio 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-2.61; p = .12; I = 41%); however, this complication was increased in the subgroup of patients who were fed enterally (odds ratio 2.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-6.56; p = .02; I = 0%). Overall, stress ulcer prophylaxis had no effect on hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.37; p = .82). The hospital mortality was, however, higher in those studies (n = 2) in which patients were fed enterally and received a histamine-2 receptor blocker (odds ratio 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.44; p = .04, I = 0%). Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression demonstrated no relationship between the treatment effect (risk of gastrointestinal bleeding) and the classification used to define gastrointestinal bleeding, the Jadad quality score nor the year the study was reported. CONCLUSIONS:: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that, in those patients receiving enteral nutrition, stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be required and, indeed, such therapy may increase the risk of pneumonia and death. However, because no clinical study has prospectively tested the influence of enteral nutrition on the risk of stress ulcer prophylaxis, our findings should be considered exploratory and interpreted with some caution.			2010				505
Prevention of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction with aspirin started in early pregnancy: a meta-analysis		Bujold, E., Roberge, S., Lacasse, Y., Bureau, M., Audibert, F., Marcoux, S., Forest, J. C. and Giguère, Y.				obstetrics and gynecology	obstetrics and gynecology	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of low-dose aspirin started in early pregnancy on the incidence of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). DATA SOURCES: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed through electronic database searches (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase). METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials of pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia who were assigned to receive aspirin or placebo (or no treatment) were reviewed. Secondary outcomes included IUGR, severe preeclampsia and preterm birth. The effect of aspirin was analyzed as a function of gestational age at initiation of the intervention (16 weeks of gestation or less, 16 weeks of gestation or more). TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Thirty-four randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, including 27 studies (11,348 women) with follow-up for the outcome of preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin started at 16 weeks or earlier was associated with a significant reduction in preeclampsia (relative risk [RR] 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.65, prevalence in 9.3% treated compared with 21.3% control) and IUGR (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30-0.65, 7% treated compared with 16.3% control), whereas aspirin started after 16 weeks was not (preeclampsia: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63-1.03, prevalence in 7.3% treated compared with 8.1% control; IUGR: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87-1.10, 10.3% treated compared with 10.5% control). Low-dose aspirin started at 16 weeks or earlier also was associated with a reduction in severe preeclampsia (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.37, 0.7% treated compared with 15.0% control), gestational hypertension (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.84, 16.7% treated compared with 29.7% control), and preterm birth (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.10-0.49, 3.5% treated compared with 16.9% control). Of note, all studies for which aspirin had been started at 16 weeks or earlier included women identified to be at moderate or high risk for preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: Low-dose aspirin initiated in early pregnancy is an efficient method of reducing the incidence of preeclampsia and IUGR.			2010				103
Treating postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture - critical appraisal of bazedoxifene: a review		Vestergaard, P. and Thomsen, S. V.				international journal of women's health	international journal of women's health	Several categories of drugs to treat osteoporosis exist in the form of bisphosphonates, strontium, parathyroid hormone, and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). Advantages and disadvantages exist for each category as some patients may, for example, not tolerate bisphosphonates for gastrointestinal side effects, and especially in women in whom osteoporosis is frequent, several options for treatment are needed. The objectives of this review were to critically appraise the effects of bazedoxifene on risk of fractures especially in women at high risk of fractures. A systematic literature search was conducted for studies, especially randomized controlled trials with fractures as end-points. Bazedoxifene is a new member of the SERM group. The literature search identified one randomized controlled trial with fractures as end-point. This was a 3-year randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial in which 7492 postmenopausal women aged 55 to 85 years were randomly allocated to 1) bazedoxifene (20 [n = 1886] or 40 [n = 1872] mg/day); 2) raloxifene (60 mg/day, n = 1849); or 3) placebo (n = 1885). The risk of vertebral fractures decreased with both 20 (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89) and 40 (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.96) mg of bazedoxifene per day compared to placebo. There was no reduction in non-vertebral fractures. A subgroup of women with a priori high risk of fractures was identified post hoc. In this subgroup there was a reduction in the risk of non-vertebral fractures with the 20 mg dose of bazedoxifene compared to placebo (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.90). In the 40 mg bazedoxifene group no significant reduction in non-vertebral fractures was seen in this subgroup (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.20). In general post-hoc defined subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution. However, the results indicate that bazedoxifene may be effective in preventing vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.			2010				856
[Systematic review: safety and efficacy of anti-TNF in elderly patients]		Busquets, N., Carmona, L. and Surís, X.				reumatología clinica	reumatología clinica	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the safety and efficacy of anti-TNF treatments in elderly patients with rheumatic diseases is similar than the safety and efficacy of the same drugs in younger patients. METHODS: Systematic review. We performed a systematic search in MEDLINE (Pubmed), EMBASE (Ovid), and the Cochrane Library Plus. Abstracts published in the American and European rheumatology congresses and articles in Reumatología Clínica were also reviewed. RESULTS: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies show a similar efficacy in elderly and younger patients. The differences between the young and the elderly regarding DAS28 reductions before and after are very small: 0.04 in the Geneway et al study and 0.0 in the Mariette et al study, as well as in the before and after HAQ: 0.04 (Geneway et al), 0.18 (Schiff et al) and 0.06 (Mariette et al).Adverse events reported in elderly and younger patients are 83.3% and 77.1% respectively with etanercept, as reported by Fleischmann; 27.2% vs 12.5%, p=0.19, as reported by Chevillotte, and the rate of withdrawal due to an adverse event was 57,8% vs 29,2% with infliximab, p=0.03, 36% vs 15% p=0.06 with adalimumab and 10,3% and 9,5%, with no significant p value, as reported by Massara. CONCLUSIONS: The information to assess the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF therapy in elderly patients was obtained in all cases from sub analyses and therefore bias is possible. We can say, with a low to moderate level of evidence, that elderly patients undergoing anti-TNF treatments have a higher number of adverse events, and similar efficacy, when compared with younger patients.			2011				990
Newer agents for blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes: systematic review and economic evaluation		Waugh, N., Cummins, E., Royle, P., Clar, C., Marien, M., Richter, B. and Philip, S.				health technology assessment (winchester, england)	health technology assessment (winchester, england)	BACKGROUND: In May 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued an updated guideline [clinical guideline (CG) 66] for the management of all aspects of type 2 diabetes. This report aims to provide information on new drug developments to support a 'new drugs update' to the 2008 guideline. OBJECTIVE: To review the newer agents available for blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes from four classes: the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue exenatide; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors sitagliptin and vildagliptin; the long-acting insulin analogues, glargine and detemir; and to review concerns about the safety of the thiazolidinediones. DATA SOURCES: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1990-April 2008), EMBASE (1990-April 2008), the Cochrane Library (all sections) Issue 2, 2008, and the Science Citation Index and ISI Proceedings (2000-April 2008). The websites of the American Diabetes Association, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency were searched, as were manufacturers' websites. REVIEW METHODS: Data extraction was carried out by one person, and checked by a second. Studies were assessed for quality using standard methods for reviews of trials. Meta-analyses were carried out using the Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan) software. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on current standard clinical practice in the UK, as outlined in NICE CG 66. The outcomes for the GLP-1 analogues, DPP-4 inhibitors and the long-acting insulin analogues were: glycaemic control, reflected by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level, hypoglycaemic episodes, changes in weight, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Modelling of the cost-effectiveness of the various regimes used the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model. RESULTS: Exenatide improved glycaemic control by around 1%, and had the added benefit of weight loss. The gliptins were effective in improving glycaemic control, reducing HbA1c level by about 0.8%. Glargine and detemir were equivalent to Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) (and to each other) in terms of glycaemic control but had modest advantages in terms of hypoglycaemia, especially nocturnal. Detemir, used only once daily, appeared to cause slightly less weight gain than glargine. The glitazones appeared to have similar effectiveness in controlling hyperglycaemia. Both can cause heart failure and fractures, but rosiglitazone appears to slightly increase the risk of cardiovascular events whereas pioglitazone reduces it. Eight trials examined the benefits of adding pioglitazone to an insulin regimen; in our meta-analysis, the mean reduction in HbA1c level was 0.54% [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.70 to -0.38] and hypoglycaemia was marginally more frequent in the pioglitazone arms [relative risk (RR) 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63]. In most studies, those on pioglitazone gained more weight than those who were not. In terms of annual drug acquisition costs among the non-insulin regimes for a representative patient with a body mass index of around 30 kg/m2, the gliptins were the cheapest of the new drugs, with costs of between 386 pounds and 460 pounds. The glitazone costs were similar, with total annual costs for pioglitazone and for rosiglitazone of around 437 pounds and 482 pounds, respectively. Exenatide was more expensive, with an annual cost of around 830 pounds. Regimens containing insulin fell between the gliptins and exenatide in terms of their direct costs, with a NPH-based regimen having an annual cost of around 468 pounds for the representative patient, whereas the glargine and detemir regimens were more expensive, at around 634 pounds and 716 pounds, respectively. Comparisons of sitagliptin and rosiglitazone, and of vidagliptin and pioglitazone slowed clinical equivalence in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), but the gliptins were marginally less costly. Exenatide, when compared with glargine, appeared to be cost-effective. Comparing glargine with NPH showed an additional anticipated cost of around 1800 pounds. Within the comparison of detemir and NPH, the overall treatment costs for detemir were slightly higher, at between 2700 pounds and 2600 pounds. LIMITATIONS: The UKPDS Outcomes Model does not directly address aspects of the treatments under consideration, for example the direct utility effects from weight loss or weight gain, severe hypoglycaemic events and the fear of severe hypoglycaemic events. Also, small differences in QALYs among the drugs lead to fluctuations in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide, the gliptins and detemir were all clinically effective. The long-acting insulin analogues glargine and detemir appeared to have only slight clinical advantages over NPH, but had much higher costs and did not appear to be cost-effective as first-line insulins for type 2 diabetes. Neither did exenatide appear to be cost-effective compared with NPH but, when used as third drug after failure of dual oral combination therapy, exenatide appeared cost-effective relative to glargine in this analysis. The gliptins are similar to the glitazones in glycaemic control and costs, and appeared to have fewer long-term side effects. Therefore, it appears, as supported by recent NICE guidelines, that NPH should be the preferred first-line insulin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. More economic analysis is required to establish when it becomes cost-effective to switch from NPH to a long-acting analogue. Also, long-term follow-up studies of exenatide and the gliptins, and data on combined insulin and exenatide treatment, would be useful.			2010				879
How to manage the left subclavian artery during endovascular stenting for thoracic aortic dissection? An assessment of the evidence		Rehman, S. M., Vecht, J. A., Perera, R., Jalil, R., Saso, S., Kidher, E., Chukwuemeka, A., Cheshire, N. J., Hamady, M. S., Darzi, A., Gibbs, R. G., Anderson, J. R. and Athanasiou, T.				annals of vascular surgery	annals of vascular surgery	BACKGROUND: Despite the publication of recent guidelines for management of the left subclavian artery (LSA) during endovascular stenting procedures of the thoracic aorta, specific management for those presenting with dissection remains unclear. This systematic review attempts to address this issue. METHODS: Systematic assessment of the published data on thoracic aorta dissection was performed identifying 46 studies, which incorporated 1,275 patients. Primary outcomes included the prevalence of left arm ischemia, stroke, spinal cord ischemia, endoleak, stent migration, and mortality. Outcomes were compared between patients with and without LSA coverage and revascularization incorporating factors such as the number of stents used, length of aorta covered, urgency of intervention, and type of dissection (acute or chronic). Statistical pooling techniques, ?(2) tests, and Fisher's exact testing were used for group comparisons. RESULTS: As compared with other outcomes, LSA coverage without revascularization in the presence of aortic dissection is much more likely to be complicated by left arm ischemia (prevalence increased from 0.0% to 4.0% [p = 0.021]), stroke (prevalence increased from 1.4% to 9.0% [p = 0.009]), and endoleak (prevalence increased from 4.0% to 29.3% [p = 0.001]). However, revascularization was not shown to reverse these effects. Longer aortic coverage (? 150 mm) was associated with an increased prevalence of spinal cord ischemia (from 1.3% to 12.5% [p = 0.011]) and mortality (from 1.3% to 15.6% [p = 0.003]). CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing endovascular stenting for thoracic aortic dissection, in cases where LSA coverage is necessary, revascularization should be considered before the procedure to avoid complications such as left arm ischemia, stroke, and endoleak, and where feasible, an appropriate preoperative assessment should be carried out.			2010				683
The use of FDG-PET in assessing axillary lymph node status in breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature		Peare, R., Staff, R. T. and Heys, S. D.				breast cancer research and treatment	breast cancer research and treatment	Axillary lymph node status is the most powerful prognostic indicator in patients with breast cancer. FDG-PET has been suggested as a non-invasive method of staging the axilla. The aim of this study was to review and aggregate all studies that measured the performance of FDG-PET in patients with breast cancer, using surgically obtained axillary histology as a reference, in a meta-analysis. A systematic review of the literature was performed and data extracted from all eligible studies. These were then analysed using meta-analysis software and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were plotted for the aggregate data. The data was then tested to determine which parameters impacted on the sensitivity and specificity of the studies. Sensitivities ranging from 20 to 100% and specificities ranging from 65 to 100% have been reported. An aggregated ROC analysis found an area under the curve of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.97) and a Q* value of 0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.92) in a total of 25 studies involving 2,460 patients. The AUC and Q* values indicated little difference between the compared study characteristics. The performance of the technique currently remains below, which is required to replace assessment of axillary node status by surgical biopsy and histological assessment. However, sensitivity and specificity are high and FDG-PET may have a role to play under particular circumstances. Moreover, the additional benefit of an assessment of distal metastatic spread provided by FDG-PET requires further investigation.			2010				641
Laparoscopic versus open appendectomy in adults with complicated appendicitis: systematic review and meta-analysis		Markides, G., Subar, D. and Riyad, K.				world journal of surgery	world journal of surgery	"BACKGROUND: The goal of the present study was to critically review and identify the strength of available evidence in the literature on the use of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) in complicated appendicitis (CA). METHODS: The Cochrane Library and Controlled Trials Registry, MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed, Web of knowledge, and SCOPUS databases were electronically searched, using the keywords ""appendectomy,"" ""laparoscopy,"" ""appendicitis."" ""complicated appendicitis."" ""gangrenous appendicitis,"" ""perforated appendicitis,"" with English language as a limit. Backward chaining was also employed. The NHS Public Health Resource Unit Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Tools were used for critical appraisal. RESULTS: Twelve retrospective case-control studies were included in the review. Overall methodological quality was moderate to poor, with heterogeneity, absence of randomization and blinding, and presence of important methodological flaws. Meta-analysis showed that LA in CA has reduced surgical site infection (SSI) rates compared to open appendectomy (OA), odds ratio (OR) 0.23, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.14-0.37 (level 3a evidence), and no difference with regard to intra-abdominal abscess (IAA) complication rates OR: 1.02, 95% CI 0.56-1.86 (level 3a evidence). CONCLUSIONS: When compared to OA, laparoscopic appendectomy is advantageous in CA with regard to SSIs, with no significant additional risk of IAA (level 3a evidence)."			2010				507
Levosimendan in acute decompensated heart failure: systematic review and meta-analysis		Ribeiro, R. A., Rohde, L. E. and Polanczyk, C. A.				arquivos brasileiros de cardiologia	arquivos brasileiros de cardiologia	BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a rather prevalent condition with a high mortality rate. Levosimendan is one among the new drugs that have been tested for its management. OBJECTIVE: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the morbidity and mortality reduction associated with levosimendan in the treatment of CHF. METHODS: A bibliographic search was conducted in the Medline database for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the use of levosimendan in CHF. The outcomes were death from all causes, length of hospital stay, and hospital readmission for CHF. All RCTs with outcomes of interest were included. Methodological quality criteria, such as blinding and confidentiality of the list of allocation, were evaluated in sensitivity analysis. The main calculation was done with random effects. RESULTS: Of the 179 articles identified, 48 were RCTs, 19 of them with outcomes of interest. In the comparison with placebo (7 trials, 1,652 patients), the relative risk (RR) for overall death was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65 to 1.18). In comparison with dobutamine (10 trials, 2,067 patients), the RR was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.75-1.02). Three studies had data on length of stay, in which levosimendan showed a decrease of 2.27 and 2.30 days compared to placebo and dobutamine, respectively (p < 0.05 for both). No article presented data on readmission alone. CONCLUSION: The evidence available so far has shown no benefit in terms of mortality in association with the use of levosimendan, which only showed a small benefit in the time of hospitalization.			2010				689
Do antipsychotics improve reasoning biases? A review		So, S. H., Garety, P. A., Peters, E. R. and Kapur, S.				psychosomatic medicine	psychosomatic medicine	"OBJECTIVE: To explore how reasoning biases in schizophrenic patients respond to treatment. Patients with schizophrenia, especially those with delusions, show not only cognitive deficits but also ""reasoning biases,"" namely, ""jumping to conclusions,"" reduced belief flexibility, an externalizing attributional style, and an impaired ""theory of mind."" METHODS: This is a systematic review of 17 longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: ""Jumping to conclusions"" and reduced ""belief flexibility"" are most closely related to the severity of delusions, whereas ""theory of mind"" is better related to negative symptoms and ""attributional style"" to overall psychopathology. Antipsychotic treatment leads to an improvement in belief flexibility and theory of mind, with the suggestion that ""belief flexibility"" may be mediating the treatment response. On the other hand, the ""jumping to conclusions"" bias is likely a stable ""trait"" factor, which does not change with treatment, although it may moderate the outcome of response. The findings above are offered with the caveat that most of the available studies are small, often uncontrolled, few are longitudinal, that the measurement of some of the reasoning measures varies across studies, and that their relationship to the more established ""cognitive"" deficits remains unclear. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that these reasoning biases could be moderators and mediators of treatment outcome provides a greater impetus to study them systematically."			2010				770
Acute wound management: revisiting the approach to assessment, irrigation, and closure considerations		Nicks, B. A., Ayello, E. A., Woo, K., Nitzki-George, D. and Sibbald, R. G.				international journal of emergency medicine	international journal of emergency medicine	BACKGROUND: As millions of emergency department (ED) visits each year include wound care, emergency care providers must remain experts in acute wound management. The variety of acute wounds presenting to the ED challenge the physician to select the most appropriate management to facilitate healing. A complete wound history along with anatomic and specific medical considerations for each patient provides the basis of decision making for wound management. It is essential to apply an evidence-based approach and consider each wound individually in order to create the optimal conditions for wound healing. AIMS: A comprehensive evidence-based approach to acute wound management is an essential skill set for any emergency physician or acute care practitioner. This review provides an overview of current evidence and addresses frequent pitfalls. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature for acute wound management was performed. RESULTS: A structured MEDLINE search was performed regarding acute wound management including established wound care guidelines. The data obtained provided the framework for evidence-based recommendations and current best practices for wound care. CONCLUSION: Acute wound management varies based on the wound location and characteristics. No single approach can be applied to all wounds; however, a systematic approach to acute wound care integrated with current best practices provides the framework for exceptional wound management.			2010				600
Helping the clinician make evidence-based implant selections. A systematic review and qualitative analysis of dental implant studies over a 20 year period		Bhatavadekar, N.				international dental journal	international dental journal	BACKGROUND: With an emerging clinician demand for evidence-based decision making for implant therapy, there is a need for an assessment of the strength and quality of evidence available for different implant systems. To the best of the author's knowledge, there is no such systematic review available which assesses studies over a wide time period. This current report thus seeks to fill this void. METHODS: A PubMed, Cochrane database, and hand search was conducted for Straumann, Nobel BioCare, 3i and Dentsply using the following limits- English language, RCT, Clinical Trials, Meta- analysis, Date range (Total of 20 years from 1 January 1988-1 January 2008), and using specific search words. Subsequently, a quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted using risk of bias as a surrogate variable for quality of a study. RESULTS: Although a large difference was found in the number of clinical trials for Nobel Biocare (higher) and Straumann (lower), there was a minimal difference in the number of randomised controlled trials between these companies. There was also a significant gap between the number of studies for both these companies, compared to the much lower number of relevant studies for 3i and Dentsply. The qualitative analysis revealed that Straumann and Nobel Biocare were closely tied behind 3i for the percentage of studies with the least risk of bias; though we need to keep in mind that 3i had far fewer relevant studies compared to both Nobel BioCare and Straumann. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides an assessment of the strength and quality of evidence for four leading implant companies. Clinicians should assess the strength of evidence before choosing an implant system. Following the guidelines from the CONSORT statement for future studies might enable standardisation and comparison across different implant systems.			2010				74
The association between continuity of care and outcomes: a systematic and critical review		van Walraven, C., Oake, N., Jennings, A. and Forster, A. J.				journal of evaluation in clinical practice	journal of evaluation in clinical practice	BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have tried to determine the association between continuity and outcomes. Studies doing so must actually measure continuity. If continuity and outcomes are measured concurrently, their association can only be determined with time-dependent methods. OBJECTIVE: To identify and summarize all methodologically studies that measure the association between continuity of care and patient outcomes. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE database (1950-2008) and hand-searched to identify studies that tried to associate continuity and outcomes. English studies were included if they: actually measured continuity; determined the association of continuity with patient outcomes; and properly accounted for the relative timing of continuity and outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 139 English language studies tried to measure the association between continuity and outcomes but only 18 studies (12.9%) met methodological criteria. All but two studies measured provider continuity and used health utilization or patient satisfaction as the outcome. Eight of nine high-quality studies found a significant association between increased continuity and decreased health utilization including hospitalization and emergency visits. Five of seven studies found improved patient satisfaction with increased continuity. CONCLUSIONS: These studies validate the belief that increased provider continuity is associated with improved patient outcomes and satisfaction. Further research is required to determine whether information or management continuity improves outcomes.			2010				850
Breast sensation after breast reconstruction: a systematic review		Shridharani, S. M., Magarakis, M., Stapleton, S. M., Basdag, B., Seal, S. M. and Rosson, G. D.				journal of reconstructive microsurgery	journal of reconstructive microsurgery	Studies show some return of breast sensation after breast reconstruction; however, recovery is variable and unpredictable. Efforts are being made to restore innervation by reattaching nerves (neurotization). We sought to systematically review the literature addressing breast sensation after reconstruction. The following databases were searched: EMBASE, Cochrane, and PubMed. Additionally, the PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY journal was hand searched from 1960 to 2009. Inclusion criteria included breast reconstruction for cancer, return of sensation with objective results, and patients aged 18 to 90 years. Studies with purely cosmetic procedures, case reports, studies with less than 10 patients, and studies involving male patients were excluded. The initial search yielded 109 studies, which was refined to 20 studies with a total pool of 638 patients. Innervated flaps have a greater magnitude of recovery, which occurs at an earlier stage compared with the noninnervated flaps. Overall, sensation to deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flaps may recover better sensation than transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps, followed by latissimus dorsi flaps, and finally implants. Women's needs and expectations for sensation have led plastic surgeons to investigate ways to facilitate its return. Studies, however, depict conflicting data. Larger series are needed to define the role of neurotization as a modality for improving sensory restoration.			2010				745
Comparative cardiovascular effects of thiazolidinediones: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies		Loke, Yoon Kong, Kwok, Chun Shing, Singh, Sonal, School of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice, University of East Anglia Norwich N. R. T. J. U. K.				bmj: british medical journal (overseas & retired doctors edition)	bmj: british medical journal (overseas & retired doctors edition)	OBJECTIVE: To determine the comparative effects of the thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) on myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. DATA SOURCES: Searches of Medline and Embase in September 2010. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies that directly compared the risk of cardiovascular outcomes for rosiglitazone and pioglitazone among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Random effects meta-analysis (inverse variance method) was used to calculate the odds ratios for cardiovascular outcomes with thiazolidinedione use. The I(2 )statistic was used to assess statistical heterogeneity. RESULTS: Cardiovascular outcomes from 16 observational studies (4 case-control studies and 12 retrospective cohort studies), including 810,000 thiazolidinedione users, were evaluated after a detailed review of 189 citations. Compared with pioglitazone, use of rosiglitazone was associated with a statistically significant increase in the odds of myocardial infarction (n = 15 studies; odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.24; P < 0.001; I(2) = 46%), congestive heart failure (n = 8; 1.22, 1.14 to 1.31; P < 0.001; I(2) = 37%), and death (n = 8; 1.14, 1.09 to 1.20; P < 0.001; I(2) = 0%). Numbers needed to treat to harm (NNH), depending on the population at risk, suggest 170 excess myocardial infarctions, 649 excess cases of heart failure, and 431 excess deaths for every 100,000 patients who receive rosiglitazone rather than pioglitazone. CONCLUSION: Among patients with type 2 diabetes, use of rosiglitazone is associated with significantly higher odds of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and death relative to pioglitazone in real world settings.			2011				1250
Diet prescription for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Is it worth the effort? A systematic review		Rossi, Megan, Hickman, Ingrid J., Queensland University of Technology, Nutrition and Dietetics, School of Public Health Kelvin Grove				nutrition & dietetics	nutrition & dietetics	The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of diet interventions for improving disease severity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A secondary aim was to identify the effectiveness of different methods of dietetic service delivery for achieving weight reduction in this patient group. A review of studies from 1999 to 2009 was conducted. Studies were included if they reported non-alcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosis by either liver histology analysis, imaging or by persistent hypertransaminasaemia, were English language studies of human adults, ?18 years, that had implemented a dietary component in the intervention. From the 102 papers identified, 20 met inclusion criteria: two randomised controlled trials, two controlled trials (allocation method not disclosed), two non-randomised experimental studies and 14 case series. Methods of diet prescription differed substantially among studies. Weight reduction appeared to be associated with a reduction in steatosis; however, improvements in other features of liver disease remain unclear. There appeared to be a relationship between the intensity of dietetic contact and weight loss. There is limited evidence available to assess the effectiveness of diet interventions on histological severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. There is good evidence that clinically significant weight reduction can improve steatosis and risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A relationship may exist between the frequency of dietetic consultations and amount of weight reduction achieved in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fortnightly intervention for a minimum of three months to achieve at least 5% weight loss is recommended.			2011				1841
Is interval appendicectomy justified after successful nonoperative treatment of an appendix mass in children? A systematic review		Hall, N. J., Jones, C. E., Eaton, S., Stanton, M. P. and Burge, D. M.				journal of pediatric surgery	journal of pediatric surgery	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Interval appendicectomy (IA) is commonly performed after successful nonoperative treatment of appendix mass (AM); although, this approach has recently been challenged. We systematically reviewed the pediatric literature with regard to the justification for this practice. METHODS: Using a defined search strategy, studies were identified and data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Incidences of recurrent appendicitis, complications after IA, and carcinoid tumor were estimated accounting for interstudy heterogeneity. Cost and length of stay of IA were analyzed. RESULTS: Three studies (127 cases) reporting routine nonsurgical treatment were identified; all were retrospective. There was marked interstudy heterogeneity and variable follow-up. After successful nonoperative treatment of AM, the risk of recurrent appendicitis is 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3%-28.4%). The incidence of complications after IA (23 studies, n = 1247) is 3.4% (95% CI, 2.2-5.1), and the incidence of carcinoid tumor found at IA (15 studies, n = 955) is 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5-1.8). No reports compared costs. Mean length of stay for IA was 3 days (range, 1-30 days). CONCLUSIONS: Prospective studies comparing routine IA with nonoperative treatment without IA in children are lacking. Available data suggest that 80% of children with AM may not need IA. A prospective study to evaluate the natural history of this condition compared with the morbidity and costs of IA is warranted.			2011				1950
[What kind of intervention has the best results to reduce the weight in overweighted or obese adults?]		Lara, M. and Amigo, H.				archivos latinoamericanos de nutrición	archivos latinoamericanos de nutrición	Evidence has shown that interventions which involve changes in a person's lifestyle, such as diet and physical activity, lead to weight loss and thus reduce the risk factors of cardiovascular disease. However, the effectiveness and necessary duration of specific interventions are unclear. The purpose of this research was to evaluate and compare the effect on weight of interventions based on diet, exercise and a combination of both. The research subjects were overweight and obese adults, at six and twelve months after the beginning of the intervention. First a systematic review was carried out, followed by a meta-analysis. Initially, 24 studies were selected which met the established criteria for inclusion; twelve of these demonstrated the required level of quality. The diet-based interventions resulted in reductions of-6.66 kilograms (95% confidence interval (CI): -9.04 to -4.28) and -3.80 kilograms (CI: -5.50 to -2.10) at six and twelve months, respectively. Those who engaged in exercise showed a loss of -2.21 kilograms (CI: -4.62 to -0.21) and -2.00 kilograms (CI: -5.70 to -1.70) at six and twelve months, respectively, while those who changed their diets and engaged in exercise showed a loss of -10.86 kilograms (CI: -13.22 to -8.49) and -6.50 kilograms (CI: -8.09 to -4.90) at six and twelve months. The combination of diet and exercise showed the best effect in reducing weight among overweight and obese people, followed by diet alone while exercise alone didn't reach significant results. The effect of these interventions was greater during the first six months of intervention.			2011				2471
[Partner notification in sexually transmitted infections. A neglected activity?]		Vallès, X., Carnicer-Pont, D. and Casabona, J.				gaceta sanitaria / s.e.s.p.a.s	gaceta sanitaria / s.e.s.p.a.s	OBJECTIVES: To undertake a critical literature review of published evidence on the effectiveness of contact tracing in sexually transmitted infections, mechanisms of referral, and the criteria for initiating this activity. To describe how these factors vary by causative agent and to characterize the current state of contact tracing in sexually transmitted infections in developed countries. METHODS: A systematic literature review was undertaken using online databases and scientific publications, as well as guidelines and documents pertaining to the legal framework within which contact tracing takes place. RESULTS: Contact tracing is specifically recommended for infections caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, syphilis and HIV. The principal approaches to contact tracing reported were patient referral, provider referral or conditional patient referral. In addition, patient-dispensed partner treatment and the use of new technologies were reported. Numerous studies have evaluated the efficacy, effectiveness and social and legal context of contact tracing in different countries and populations. This situation contrasts with that in Spain, where there is a notable absence of guidelines, legal framework and formal studies dealing with contact tracing in sexually transmitted infections. CONCLUSIONS: Contact tracing is an increasingly important tool in the public health management of sexually transmitted infections and should be valued as such. This activity should be an integral and effective component of the control and prevention of sexually transmitted infection programmes in all autonomous regions in Spain. Research in this field is required to develop the legal framework and practice guidelines appropriate to the local context.			2011				2214
Telemedicine for stroke: a systematic review		Roots, Angela, Bhalla, Ajay, Birns, Jonathan, practice development nurse, Department of Ageing and Health, St ThomasÂ¿ Hospital London				british journal of neuroscience nursing	british journal of neuroscience nursing	Inequalities in stroke patient care have been demonstrated in different locations and at different times. To overcome the inequity of access to specialist stroke care, telemedicine systems have been developed to provide remote specialist assessment of patients with real-time clinical evaluation for hyperacute care and rehabilitation. An electronic database search was performed of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library and extensive manual searching of articles was conducted to identify studies investigating the use of telemedicine in managing acute stroke and post-stroke rehabilitation. There were 20 observational and 2 randomized, controlled acute studies involving 15872 patients and 2 observational and 4 randomized controlled rehabilitation studies involving 112 patients that met the inclusion criteria. Telemedicine for stroke, in both acute and rehabilitation settings, was demonstrated to be safe, effective, feasible and acceptable and was shown to reduce geographical differences and increase diagnostic accuracy and uptake of thrombolytic treatment.			2011				1597
The effectiveness of two-compound formulation calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate gel in the treatment of moderately severe scalp psoriasis: a systematic review of direct and indirect evidence		Bottomley, J. M., Taylor, R. S. and Ryttov, J.				current medical research and opinion	current medical research and opinion	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the two-compound formulation (TCF) calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate (BDP) gel versus other topical therapies for scalp psoriasis in adults using direct and indirect comparisons. METHODS: A systematic review identified 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical treatments used in clinical practice for moderately severe scalp psoriasis. A meta-analysis was undertaken to obtain estimates of clinical effectiveness using recommended efficacy and safety outcome measures. We determined the proportion of responding patients using two definitions: i) 'controlled disease' using the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) rating scale and ii) a score of 0 or 1 on the Total Sign Score (TSS). Tolerability was extracted in terms of percentages of patients experiencing all adverse events (AEs), skin AEs and withdrawals due to AEs. Direct comparisons were performed where head-to-head data were available. For other comparators where TCF gel was compared indirectly, 'pairs' of trials were compared on the basis of a common comparator using meta-regression in order to derive an indirect comparison estimate, while preserving randomisation within trials. Assumptions of comparability were considered regarding study homogeneity (data can be pooled in a meta-analysis), similarity of trials (clinical and methodological) and consistency of findings from direct and indirect evidence. RESULTS: The meta-analysis showed that TCF gel was statistically significantly more effective than other topical treatments in terms of achieving a response defined according to both IGA and TSS criteria. TCF gel was generally associated with a statistically significant lower risk of AEs, skin AEs or patients withdrawing from RCTs due to AEs. CONCLUSIONS: Although direct and indirect evidence in this analysis is sparse, this indirect comparison suggests that the TCF gel has significant benefits over other topical therapies considered in the routine management of patients with moderately severe scalp psoriasis. Despite other analysis limitations in terms of study heterogeneity inevitable across an evidence base spanning decades, these results were consistent, using a number of efficacy and tolerability outcome measures.			2011				1587
Effect of methadone maintenance treatment on heroin craving, a literature review		Fareed, A., Vayalapalli, S., Stout, S., Casarella, J., Drexler, K. and Bailey, S. P.				journal of addictive diseases	journal of addictive diseases	Despite agreement that methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is an effective and safe option for treatment of heroin dependence, there have been controversies about its effect on heroin craving. A systematic literature review of the PubMed database was used to find studies eligible for inclusion in the study. The authors present the results of 16 articles that met all inclusion criteria. Overall, 7 studies reported that methadone could reduce heroin craving, 4 studies reported that patients in MMT are still at risk of having heroin craving, 1 study reported that methadone could increase heroin craving, and 4 studies reported that methadone has a neutral effect on heroin craving. One may speculate from these data that methadone may help with heroin craving, but patients in MMT may still be at risk of cue-induced heroin cravings. Methadone provides a helpful tool for reducing some components of craving and risk of relapse for patient receiving MMT.			2011				2164
Evidence for the efficacy of complementary and alternative medicines in the management of osteoarthritis: a systematic review		De Silva, V., El-Metwally, A., Ernst, E., Lewith, G., Macfarlane, G. J., Arthritis Research, U. K. Working Group on Complementary and Alternative, Medicines				rheumatology (oxford, england)	rheumatology (oxford, england)	Objectives. To critically evaluate the evidence regarding complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) taken orally or applied topically (excluding glucosamine and chondroitin) in the treatment of OA. Methods. Randomized clinical trials of OA using CAMs, in comparison with other treatments or placebo, published in English up to January 2009, were eligible for inclusion. They were identified using systematic searches of bibliographic databases and manual searching of reference lists. Information was extracted on outcomes, and statistical significance, in comparison with alternative treatment of placebo, and side effects were reported. The methodological quality of the primary studies was determined. Results. The present review found consistent evidence that capsaicin gel and S-adenosyl methionine were effective in the management of OA. There was also some consistency to the evidence that Indian Frankincense, methylsulphonylmethane and rose hip may be effective. For other substances with promising evidence, the evidence base was either insufficiently large or the evidence base was inconsistent. Most of the CAM compounds studied were free of major adverse effects. Conclusion. The major limitation in reviewing the evidence is the paucity of randomized controlled trials in the area: widening the evidence base, particularly for those compounds for which there is promising evidence, should be a priority for both researchers and funders.			2011				1474
Pre-hospital haemostatic dressings: a systematic review		Granville-Chapman, J., Jacobs, N. and Midwinter, M. J.				injury	injury	BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled haemorrhage is a leading cause of prehospital death after military and civilian trauma. Exsanguination from extremity wounds causes over half of preven military combat deaths and wounds to the anatomical junctional zones provide a particular challenge for first responders. Commercial products have been developed, which claim to outperform standard gauze bandages in establishing and maintaining non-surgical haemostasis. Since 2004, two advanced haemostatic dressing products, HemCon and QuikClot have been widely deployed in military operations. Newer products have since become available which aim to provide more efficient haemostasis than and thus supersede HemCon and QuikClot. AIM: To conduct a systematic review of clinical and preclinical evidence to compare the relative efficacy and safety of available haemostatic products, which are of relevance to pre-hospital military and civilian emergency medical providers. METHOD: An English language literature search was performed, using PubMed and Web of Knowledge Databases, with cross-referencing, focussed product searches and communication with product manufacturers. For studies employing animal models, the injury model was required to produce fatal haemorrhage. Products were categorised by primary mode of action as either factor concentrators,mucoadhesive agents or procoagulant supplementors. RESULTS: From 60 articles collated, 6 clinical papers and 37 preclinical animal trials were eligible for inclusion in this review. Products have been tested in three different types of haemorrhage model: low pressure, high volume venous bleeding, high pressure arterial bleeding and mixed arterial-venous bleeding. The efficacy of products varies with the model adopted. Criteria for the 'ideal battle field haemostatic dressing' have previously been defined by Pusateri, but no product has yet attained suchstatus. Since 2004, HemCon (a mucoadhesive agent) and QuikClot (a factor concentrator) have been widely deployed by United States and United Kingdom Armed Forces; retrospective clinical data supports their efficacy. However, in some recent animal models of lethal haemorrhage, WoundStat(mucoadhesive), Celox (mucoadhesive) and CombatGauze (procoagulant supplementor) have all outperformed both HemCon and QuikClot products. CONCLUSION: HemCon and QuikClot have augmented the haemostatic capabilities of the military first aid responder, but newer products demonstrate potential to be more effective and should be considered as replacements for current in service systems. These products could have utility for civilian pre-hospital care.			2011				937
The role of hypothermia in post-cardiac arrest patients with return of spontaneous circulation: a systematic review		Walters, J. H., Morley, P. T. and Nolan, J. P.				resuscitation	resuscitation	"OBJECTIVES: To update a comprehensive systematic review of the use of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest that was undertaken initially as part of the 2010 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science. The specific question addressed was: 'in post-cardiac arrest patients with a return of spontaneous circulation, does the induction of mild hypothermia improve morbidity or mortality when compared with usual care?' METHODS: Pubmed was searched using (""heart arrest"" or ""cardiopulmonary resuscitation"") AND ""hypothermia, induced"" using 'Clinical Queries' search strategy; EmBASE was searched using (heart arrest) OR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) AND hypothermia; The Cochrane database of systematic reviews; ECC EndNote Library for ""hypothermia"" in abstract OR title. Excluded were animal studies, reviews and editorials, surveys of implementation, analytical models, reports of single cases, pre-arrest or during arrest cooling and group where the intervention was not hypothermia alone. RESULTS: 77 studies met the criteria for further review. Of these, four were meta-analyses (LOE 1); seven were randomised controlled trials (LOE 1), although six of these were from the same set of patients; nine were non-randomised, concurrent controls (LOE 2); 15 were trials with retrospective controls (LOE 3); 40 had no controls (LOE 4); and one was extrapolated from a non-cardiac arrest group (LOE 5). CONCLUSION: There is evidence supporting the use of mild therapeutic hypothermia to improve neurological outcome in patients who remain comatose following the return of spontaneous circulation after a cardiac arrest; however, much of the evidence is from low-level, observational studies. Of seven randomised controlled trials, six use data from the same patients."			2011				1168
Preventing the second episode: a systematic review and meta-analysis of psychosocial and pharmacological trials in first-episode psychosis		Alvarez-Jiménez, M., Parker, A. G., Hetrick, S. E., McGorry, P. D. and Gleeson, J. F.				schizophrenia bulletin	schizophrenia bulletin	OBJECTIVE: The majority of first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients reach clinical remission; however, rates of relapse are high. This study sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent relapse in FEP patients. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs. RESULTS: Of 66 studies retrieved, 18 were eligible for inclusion. Nine studies investigated psychosocial interventions and 9 pharmacological treatments. The analysis of 3 RCTs of psychosocial interventions comparing specialist FEP programs vs treatment as usual involving 679 patients demonstrated the former to be more effective in preventing relapse (odds ratio [OR]=1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.31-2.48; P<.001; number needed to treat [NNT]=10). While the analysis of 3 different cognitive-behavioral studies not specifically intended at preventing relapse showed no further benefits compared with specialist FEP programs (OR=1.95, 95% CI=0.76-5.00; P=.17), the combination of specific individual and family intervention targeted at relapse prevention may further improve upon these outcomes (OR=4.88, 95% CI=0.97-24.60; P=.06). Only 3 small studies compared first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) with placebo with no significant differences regarding relapse prevention although all individual estimates favored FGAs (OR=2.82, 95% CI=0.54-14.75; P=.22). Exploratory analysis involving 1055 FEP patients revealed that relapse rates were significantly lower with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) compared with FGAs (OR=1.47, 95% CI=1.07-2.01; P<.02; NNT=10). CONCLUSIONS: Specialist FEP programs are effective in preventing relapse. Cognitive-based individual and family interventions may need to specifically target relapse to obtain relapse prevention benefits that extend beyond those provided by specialist FEP programs. Overall, the available data suggest that FGAs and SGAs have the potential to reduce relapse rates. Future trials should examine the effectiveness of placebo vs antipsychotics in combination with intensive psychosocial interventions in preventing relapse in the early course of psychosis. Further studies should identify those patients who may not need antipsychotic medication to be able to recover from psychosis.			2011				1461
The chiropractic care of infants with colic: a systematic review of the literature		Alcantara, J., Alcantara, J. D. and Alcantara, J.				explore (new york, n.y.)	explore (new york, n.y.)	PURPOSE: To perform a systematic review of the literature on the chiropractic care of patients with infantile colic. METHODS: The following databases were interrogated: MANTIS [1965-2010]; Pubmed [1966-2010]; Index to Chiropractic Literature [1984-2010]; EMBASE [1974-2010]; AMED [1967-2010]; CINAHL [1964-2010]; Alt-Health Watch [1965-2010], and PsychINFO [1965-2010]. Inclusion criteria were manuscripts addressing the chiropractic care of infantile colic published in the English language. RESULTS: Our systematic review of the literature revealed 26 articles meeting our inclusion criteria. These consisted of three clinical trials, two survey studies, six case reports, two case series, four cohort studies, five commentaries, and four reviews of the literature. Our findings reveal that chiropractic care is a viable alternative to the care of infantile colic and congruent with evidence-based practice, particularly when one considers that medical care options are no better than placebo or have associated adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Chiropractic care is an alternative approach to the care of the child with colic. We encourage more research, both quantitative and qualitative, in this area of pediatric care.			2011				1092
The role of dopamine agonists in the treatment of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease: a systematic review		Leentjens, A. F.				drugs	drugs	Depressive disorders as well as depressive symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and an important factor affecting quality of life. Treatment of depressive symptoms not only improves mood but is also associated with improvement of motor symptoms, disability and cognitive symptoms. Currently, dopamine agonists are being suggested as an alternative to antidepressants for the treatment of depression in PD. The aim of this article is to systematically review the efficacy of dopamine agonists in the treatment of depression in PD. Since 1983, 19 studies have reported on the effects of dopamine agonists on depressive disorder, depressive symptoms or mood in PD. To date, no double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial of the treatment of major depressive disorder in PD with a dopamine agonist has been conducted. Studies of the effects of treatment with dopamine agonists on depressive symptoms in PD, or on mood in non-depressed PD patients, have yielded inconclusive results. Most studies are not designed to test effects on mood and are limited by methodological flaws. It can be concluded that, although the preliminary evidence of the effects on mood and depression in PD is interesting and in need of further study, there is as yet insufficient evidence to recommend dopamine agonists in the treatment of either depressive disorder or depressive symptoms in patients with PD. Treatment of depressive disorder and clinically relevant depressive symptoms should be based on pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions with known efficacy in this population, such as citalopram, nortriptyline, desipramine or cognitive behavioural therapy. This strategy has the additional advantage of enabling the clinician to treat depressive symptoms independently of motor symptoms, thus avoiding potential complications of dopaminergic therapy.			2011				1991
Effectiveness of silver in wound care treatment		Moore, C. and Young, J.				physical therapy reviews	physical therapy reviews	BACKGROUND: Topical treatments impregnated with silver are being increasingly used in the treatment of acute and chronic wounds; however, the evidence on the effectiveness of silver wound care treatment is in question. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the literature examining the effectiveness of silver in wound care treatment. METHODS: Research databases were consulted including the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ProQuest, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant clinical trials from 2000 to 2009. Studies deemed to have met inclusion criteria were scored using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale and those scoring 4/10 or higher were included in this review. RESULTS: Five clinical trials were identified including three randomized control trials including a total of 410 subjects. Methodological quality ranged from 4 to 10 out of 10. All five research studies showed positive effects of the use of silver dressings or topical agents. CONCLUSION: This literature review analyzed the effectiveness of sliver hydroalginate, Contreet foam, hydrofiber Ag dressings along with hyaluronic acid plus silver sulfadiazine and silver sulfadiazine topical agents in wound care. Second degree burns, venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers and open surgical and traumatic wounds were analyzed in the included studies. The results of this literature review demonstrate that silver dressings and topical agents are promising as safe and effective treatment methods for wound care patients throughout the treatment period in the selected studies. However, further research should be conducted to provide additional evidence on the effectiveness of silver dressings and topical agents.			2013				3705
Meta-analysis on the efficacy of foot-and-mouth disease emergency vaccination		Halasa, T., Boklund, A., Cox, S. and Enøe, C.				preventive veterinary medicine	preventive veterinary medicine	The objectives of this study were to provide a summary quantification of the efficacy of FMD emergency vaccination based on a systematic review and a meta-analysis of available literature, and to further discuss the suitability of this review and meta-analysis to summarize and further interpret the results. Peer-reviewed, symposium, and unpublished studies were considered in the analysis. Clinical protection and virological protection against FMD were used as parameters to assess the efficacy of emergency vaccination. The clinical protection was estimated based on the appearance of clinical signs including FMD lesions and fever, while the virological protection parameter was estimated based on the outcome of laboratory tests that were used to diagnose FMD infection. A meta-analysis relative risk was calculated per protection parameter. Results of the meta-analyses were examined using publication bias tests. In total, 31 studies were included in the analyses, of which 26 were peer-reviewed studies, 1 was a symposium study and 4 were unpublished studies. Cattle, swine and sheep were well protected against clinical disease and FMD infection following the use of emergency vaccine. Fortunately, no significant bias that would alter the conclusions was encountered in the analysis. Meta-analysis can be a useful tool to summarize literature results from a systematic review of the efficacy of FMD emergency vaccination.			2011				2092
Pharmacological interventions to attenuate the expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) - a systematic review		Bergqvist, D.				european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	INTRODUCTION: Is it possible by pharmacological methods to attenuate the expansion rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms? METHOD: An Internet-based systematic literature search was performed to identify published reports on pharmacological methods to influence aneurysmal expansion rate. RESULTS: Of an original 450 articles, 21 remained to review: they included 15 cohort studies with 12,321 patients and seven randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with 1069 patients. Most studies are performed without a pre-study sample size calculation. There is no consistent pattern of pharmacological influence on expansion rate, but statins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and macrolides should be further evaluated. CONCLUSION: Properly designed RCTs are needed before conclusions can be drawn on the possibility to pharmacologically attenuate aneurysmal expansion and prevent rupture.			2011				1125
Systematic review and mixed treatment comparison of randomized evidence for empirical, pre-emptive and directed treatment strategies for invasive mould disease		Freemantle, N., Tharmanathan, P. and Herbrecht, R.				the journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy	the journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy	Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the most reliable estimates of the effects of treatments. However, not all treatments are compared in available RCTs, making comparison of treatments problematic. Mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs) can provide estimates of the comparative effects of treatments across a range of available therapeutic options. MTCs use networks of available direct comparisons to estimate differences in treatments that have not been estimated in trials via a common comparator. We conducted a systematic review and MTCs of comparative RCTs in haematological patients of anti-mould active agents used for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia (Analysis 1), and pre-emptive therapy (Analysis 2) of invasive mould diseases. In addition, we summarized the evidence available associated with the use of directed treatment strategies (Analysis 3). For empirical therapy, caspofungin proved superior to amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B, amphotericin B lipid complex and voriconazole in the outcome of survival, but no agents showed superiority for treatment response. There was no evidence of a difference between pre-emptive and empirical strategies on mortality outcomes. For directed therapy, voriconazole was superior to amphotericin B for overall survival, and both voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B were superior to amphotericin B and amphotericin B colloidal dispersion on the outcome of response. While limited to some degree by the availability of RCTs, the MTCs reported here provide the best available evidence of relative therapeutic success for different available treatment strategies.			2011				1490
Is psychoeducation for parents and teachers of children and adolescents with ADHD efficacious? A systematic literature review		Montoya, A., Colom, F. and Ferrin, M.				european psychiatry : the journal of the association of european psychiatrists	european psychiatry : the journal of the association of european psychiatrists	OBJECTIVE: To identify evidence from comparative studies on the effects of psychoeducation programs on clinical outcomes in children and adolescents with ADHD. METHOD: Articles published between January 1980 and July 2010 were searched through electronic databases and hand search. A qualitative systematic review of comparative studies of psychoeducation in ADHD was performed. Psychoeducation was considered if studies use a specific therapeutic program focusing on the didactically communication of information and provide patients and families with coping skills. RESULTS: Seven studies were identified (four randomized-controlled trials, three uncontrolled pre-post treatment designs). Studies differed on whether psychoeducation approaches were applied to parents of ADHD children (three studies), to ADHD children/adolescents and their families (three studies) or to their teachers (one study). Positive outcomes measured as improvement on a number of different variables, including patient's behavior, parent and child satisfaction, child's knowledge of ADHD, children's opinion of the use of medication and adherence to medical recommendations were found. CONCLUSIONS: Although available evidence is limited and some findings may be difficult to be interpreted, the positive role of psychoeducation and other educational interventions in children and adolescents with ADHD in regard to several outcome measures is supported by most of the literature referenced in this review.			2011				1443
[Effectiveness and safety of methylphenidate and atomoxetine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review]		Lv, X. Z., Shu, Z., Zhang, Y. W., Wu, S. S. and Zhan, S. Y.				zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics	zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics	OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the effectiveness and safety of methylphenidate immediate-release tablets (IR-MPH), methylphenidate controlled release tablets (OROS-MPH) and atomoxetine (AHC) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Chinese children. METHODS: Randomized or clinical controlled trials on the effectiveness and safety of IR-MPH, OROS-MPH and AHC for ADHD were searched in electronic databases of CNKI, VIP, CBMDISC online, PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the quality of the included literatures. RESULTS: Eight trials were finally included. IR-MPH, OROS-MPH and AHC were effective for ADHD. OROS-MPH was superior to IR-MPH in the improvement of peer relationship, CGI-I score, mother satisfaction and psychosomatic problems. There were no significant differences in the effectiveness between the AHC and IR-MPH groups. The adverse events related to the therapy with IR-MPH, OROS-MPH or AHC were mild and the incidence rates of adverse events were not significantly different among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of OROS-MPH for the treatment of ADHD is probably superior to IR-MPH, and the effectiveness between AHC and IR-MPH is similar. The three drugs demonstrate the safety and well tolerance.			2011				1759
A systematic review of bile acid sequestrant therapy in children with familial hypercholesterolemia		Davidson, M. H.				journal of clinical lipidology	journal of clinical lipidology	Familial hypercholesterolemia, which arises as a result of a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene, is characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), regardless of dietary and lifestyle modifications. Pharmacological therapy is often required to adequately control the elevated LDL-C levels associated with familial hypercholesterolemia. However, children with this genetic condition present many challenges for physicians, who must weigh the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy against the risks associated with the various treatment options. Furthermore, because familial hypercholesterolemia is a chronic condition, children will likely require long-term lipid-lowering therapy. As such, the potential effect of pharmacological treatment on development is of paramount importance in this population. Bile acid sequestrants represent a unique treatment option for children with familial hypercholesterolemia in that these agents are not systemically absorbed but rather exert their lipid-lowering effects via binding to bile acids within the gastrointestinal tract. A literature search was performed to identify clinical data related to the use of bile acid sequestrant therapy in children (< 18 years of age) with familial hypercholesterolemia. Studies published in English between 1990 and December 2010 that were retrieved from MEDLINE and EMBASE were included in this systematic review. In total, five clinical studies were identified that evaluated bile acid sequestrant monotherapy, whereas two studies were identified that evaluated combination therapy with a bile acid sequestrant and low-dose statin. This review summarizes the clinical data regarding the efficacy and safety of bile acid sequestrants in this specialized population.			2011				1184
Efficacy of calcium supplementation for management of overweight and obesity: systematic review of randomized clinical trials		Onakpoya, I. J., Perry, R., Zhang, J. and Ernst, E.				nutrition reviews	nutrition reviews	Numerous dietary supplements are marketed as slimming aids, but the efficacy of most has not been proven. One such slimming aid is calcium. Presented here are the results of a systematic review that aimed to evaluate the evidence for or against the efficacy of calcium supplements for body-weight reduction in overweight and obese individuals. Electronic searches were conducted to identify relevant randomized clinical trials of at least 6 months duration. No restrictions of age, gender, language, or time of publication were imposed. Two reviewers independently determined the eligibility of studies, assessed the reporting quality of the studies included, and extracted data. Twenty-four eligible trials were identified, and seven were included. Five of the randomized clinical trials included were not of good reporting quality. A meta-analysis revealed a small, significant reduction in body weight for calcium compared with placebo (mean difference, -0.74?kg; 95% confidence interval, -1.00-0.48). A small, significant reduction in body fat favoring calcium over placebo was also noted (mean difference, -0.93?kg; 95% confidence interval, -1.16-0.71). In conclusion, the evidence from randomized clinical trials suggests calcium supplementation generates small, statistically significant weight loss in overweight and obese individuals, but the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain.			2011				1310
Is early surgery beneficial in infective endocarditis? A systematic review		Delahaye, F.				archives of cardiovascular diseases	archives of cardiovascular diseases	We do not know whether surgery during the active phase of infective endocarditis improves prognosis, as no randomized trial data exist. Several observational studies published recently have examined the influence of surgery on prognosis by performing a propensity score analysis. The aim of the present paper is to review these studies, in order to determine whether or not early surgery decreases mortality in adult patients with infective endocarditis. Among nine published studies, 4199 patients were included overall. The rate of surgery during the active phase of infective endocarditis ranged from 23 to 53%. Surgery was significantly beneficial in six studies (adjusted hazard ratios or odds ratios ranging from 0.27 to 0.47), neutral in two studies and without benefit in one study (hazard ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.1-3.2). Conflicting results appear to be related to differences in statistical methods. When using appropriate models, surgery is significantly associated with reduced long-term mortality. Results from these observational studies suggest that current surgical practices in infective endocarditis are beneficial in terms of long-term survival. However, we cannot conclude that surgery is beneficial and must be performed in all patients with infective endocarditis. Surgery was associated with a favourable outcome in those patients in whom infective endocarditis presentation and patient characteristics led the physicians to perform surgery. Patients who seem to benefit most from surgery are those who fulfil management guidelines (embolic event, heart failure and/or intracardiac abscess).			2011				1615
Eradicating chronic ear, nose, and throat infections: a systematically conducted literature review of advances in biofilm treatment		Smith, A., Buchinsky, F. J. and Post, J. C.				otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of american academy of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery	otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of american academy of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery	OBJECTIVE: Bacteria can grow as individual, planktonic organisms or as complex biofilm communities that are more resistant to treatment. This review was designed to systematically search to identify recent laboratory studies on eradication of biofilms in otolaryngologic infections to highlight promising advances in biofilm treatment. DATA SOURCES: A systematic electronic literature search of Medline/PubMed, CINHAL, and Web of Science was conducted for articles describing the treatment of biofilm infections in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) diseases through March 2010. English-language articles and articles with an English abstract that focused on biofilm treatment were considered for review. REVIEW METHODS: Each included article was reviewed by one of the authors for study design, treatment intervention, and outcome. Data from in vitro and animal studies were considered separately from human studies. RESULTS: A total of 30 articles were identified for this review, including 5 studies that included a human treatment component. In general, antibiotics were relatively ineffective for eradicating biofilm infections. Markedly higher antibiotic dosages were required to reduce biofilm presence compared with doses that were effective in eradicating planktonic bacteria. Mupirocin irrigation, gentian violet, and thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteine effectively eradicated biofilms. Physical disruption, surfactants, and probiotics were also shown to be beneficial in both nonhuman and human studies. CONCLUSION: Eradicating ENT biofilms is difficult when treating single-organism or mixed flora biofilms. Antibiotic therapy is often ineffective against biofilms, and clinical treatment may need to focus on nonantibiotic therapies that reduce, disrupt, or eradicate ENT biofilms.			2011				2136
A systematic review of digital interactive television systems and their applications in the health and social care fields		Blackburn, S., Brownsell, S. and Hawley, M. S.				journal of telemedicine and telecare	journal of telemedicine and telecare	We conducted a systematic review of the applications and technical features of digital interactive television (DITV) in the health and social care fields. The Web of Knowledge and IEEE Xplore databases were searched for articles published between January 2000 and March 2010 which related to DITV systems facilitating the communication of information to/from an individual's home with either a health or social care application. Out of 1679 articles retrieved, 42 met the inclusion criteria and were selected for review. An additional 20 articles were obtained from online grey literature sources. Twenty-five DITV systems operating in health and social care were identified, including seven commercial systems. The most common applications were related to health care, such as vital signs monitoring (68% of systems) and health information or advice (56% of systems). The most common technical features of DITV systems were two-way communication (88%), medical peripherals (68%), on-screen messaging (48%) and video communication (36%). Digital interactive television has the potential to deliver health and social care to people in their own homes. However, the requirement for a high-bandwidth communications infrastructure, the usability of the systems, their level of personalisation and the lack of evidence regarding clinical and cost-effectiveness will all need to be addressed if this approach is to flourish.			2011				1445
Use of procalcitonin for the detection of sepsis in the critically ill burn patient: A systematic review of the literature		Mann, E. A., Wood, G. L. and Wade, C. E.				burns : journal of the international society for burn injuries	burns : journal of the international society for burn injuries	Abstract: The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for use of routine procalcitonin testing to diagnose the presence of sepsis in the burn patient. The electronic databases MEDLINE, Cochrane, CINAHL, ProQuest, and SCOPUS were searched for relevant studies using the MeSH terms burn, infection, procalcitonin, and meta-analysis. The focus of the review was the adult burn population, but other relevant studies of critically ill patients were included as data specific to the patient with burns are limited. Studies were compiled in tabular form and critically appraised for quality and level of evidence. Four meta-analyses, one review of the literature, one randomized controlled trial, nine prospective observational, and three retrospective studies were retrieved. Six of these studies were specific to the burn population, with one specific to burned children. Only one meta-analysis, one adult burn and one pediatric burn study reported no benefit of procalcitonin testing to improve diagnosis of sepsis or differentiate sepsis from non-infectious systemic inflammatory response. The collective findings of the included studies demonstrated benefit of incorporating procalcitonin assay into clinical sepsis determination. Evaluation of the burn specific studies is limited by the use of guidelines to define sepsis and inconsistent results from the burn studies. Utility of the procalcitonin assay is limited due to the lack of availability of rapid, inexpensive tests. However, it appears procalcitonin assay is a safe and beneficial addition to the clinical diagnosis of sepsis in the burn intensive care unit.			2011				1402
Manual therapy for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee  a systematic review		French, H. P., Brennan, A., White, B. and Cusack, T.				manual therapy	manual therapy	Abstract: The aim of this systematic review was to determine if manual therapy improves pain and/or physical function in people with hip or knee OA. Eight databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data were extracted and risk of bias assessed by independent reviewers. Four RCTs were eligible for inclusion (280 subjects), three of which studied people with knee OA and one studied those with hip OA. One study compared manual therapy to no treatment, one compared to placebo intervention, whilst two compared to alternative interventions. Meta-analysis was not possible due to clinical heterogeneity of the studies. One study had a low risk of bias and three had high risk of bias. All studies reported short-term effects, and long-term effects were measured in one study. There is silver level evidence that manual therapy is more effective than exercise for those with hip OA in the short and long-term. Due to the small number of RCTs and patients, this evidence could be considered to be inconclusive regarding the benefit of manual therapy on pain and function for knee or hip OA.			2011				1328
Interventions for the prevention and treatment of postpartum psychosis: a systematic review		Doucet, S., Jones, I., Letourneau, N., Dennis, C. L. and Blackmore, E. R.				archives of women's mental health	archives of women's mental health	Postpartum psychosis is a serious disorder that can cause negative consequences for the mother, infant, and entire family. While reports of this condition date back for centuries, little is known about what interventions are most effective for this population. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the research evidence on interventions for the prevention and treatment of postpartum psychosis. Studies were searched using CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases. All primary research studies published in English since 1970 that explored interventions for the prevention or treatment of postpartum psychosis were included. The search resulted in 26 studies on interventions for postpartum psychosis, with 10 focusing on prevention and 17 focusing on treatment. Studies on the prevention of postpartum psychosis have examined the effects of mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and hormone therapy, while those examining treatment have included electroconvulsive therapy, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, hormones, and the beta blocker propranolol. Only preliminary evidence suggests which interventions may be effective strategies to prevent (e.g., lithium) and treat (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy) postpartum psychosis. Due to methodological limitations in the studies reviewed, extensive evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum psychosis cannot be made. The known risk factors and negative consequences of postpartum psychosis point to the importance of preventative and acute treatment measures. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to determine the efficacy of prevention and treatment interventions for women who experience postpartum psychosis.			2011				1298
A comparison of early versus late initiation of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Karvellas, C. J., Farhat, M. R., Sajjad, I., Mogensen, S. S., Leung, A. A., Wald, R. and Bagshaw, S. M.				critical care (london, england)	critical care (london, england)	INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to investigate the impact of early versus late initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis were used in this study. PUBMED, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Clinical Trials, and other sources were searched in July 2010. Eligible studies selected were cohort and randomised trials that assessed timing of initiation of RRT in critically ill adults with AKI. RESULTS: We identified 15 unique studies (2 randomised, 4 prospective cohort, 9 retrospective cohort) out of 1,494 citations. The overall methodological quality was low. Early, compared with late therapy, was associated with a significant improvement in 28-day mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28 to 0.72). There was significant heterogeneity among the 15 pooled studies (I(2) = 78%). In subgroup analyses, stratifying by patient population (surgical, n = 8 vs. mixed, n = 7) or study design (prospective, n = 10 vs. retrospective, n = 5), there was no impact on the overall summary estimate for mortality. Meta-regression controlling for illness severity (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)), baseline creatinine and urea did not impact the overall summary estimate for mortality. Of studies reporting secondary outcomes, five studies (out of seven) reported greater renal recovery, seven (out of eight) studies showed decreased duration of RRT and five (out of six) studies showed decreased ICU length of stay in the early, compared with late, RRT group. Early RRT did not; however, significantly affect the odds of dialysis dependence beyond hospitalization (OR 0.62 0.34 to 1.13, I(2) = 69.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Earlier institution of RRT in critically ill patients with AKI may have a beneficial impact on survival. However, this conclusion is based on heterogeneous studies of variable quality and only two randomised trials. In the absence of new evidence from suitably-designed randomised trials, a definitive treatment recommendation cannot be made.			2011				1583
[Cost-benefit analysis of amniotic membrane transplantation for venous ulcers of the legs that are refractory to conventional treatment]		Gutiérrez-Moreno, S., Alsina-Gibert, M., Sampietro-Colom, L., Pedregosa-Fauste, S. and Ayala-Blanco, P.				actas dermo-sifiliográficas	actas dermo-sifiliográficas	BACKGROUND: Standard compression therapy for venous ulcers of the legs does not promote healing. Although autografting accelerates tissue repair, it is difficult to use in patients with concomitant diseases or when multiple grafts are required. The amniotic membrane has been used as a covering material and promotes epithelialization, making it a good potential treatment option when autografts are not indicated. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the literature on the safety and efficacy of amniotic membrane grafting and compare the cost of currently available grafts (autografts, amniotic membrane grafts, and biocompatible skin substitutes) to promote tissue repair in venous ulcers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature on the use of amniotic membrane grafts for the treatment of venous ulcers was performed up to 2010. A cost-minimization analysis of direct healthcare costs was then performed (at 3 and 6 months). A sensitivity analysis was performed to confirm the stability of the results. RESULTS: Only 1 study addressing safety and efficacy was identified. The cost-minimization analysis showed that autografts are always the least-expensive option ( 1053 compared with  1825 for amniotic membrane grafts and  5767 for biocompatible skin grafts). At 6 months, however, amniotic membrane grafts would have cost  6765 less than the use of biocompatible skin substitutes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite having excellent therapeutic potential for the re-epithelialization of venous ulcers that do not respond to conventional treatment, amniotic membrane transplant remains an experimental therapy. Autograft is the most efficient treatment but amniotic membrane graft is less expensive than the use of biocompatible skin substitutes.			2011				2352
[Literature review of the efficacy and safety of hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy after cytoreductive surgery in the treatment of pseudomyxoma peritonei]		Ba, M. C., Cui, S. Z., Luo, F. T., Ouyang, W. W., Tang, Y. Q., Wu, Y. B. and Tang, H. S.				zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery	zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery	OBJECTIVE: To evaluated the safety and efficacy of hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy(HIPC) in the prevention and treatment of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) recurrence after cytoreductive surgery(CRS). METHODS: Studies published in English before 2010 on HIPC after CRS for PMP were searched in PubMed database. Each study was carefully evaluated based on pre-determined criteria. Study results were comprehensively displayed in a form. A descriptive systematic review was performed. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies were included. The median survival time of patients in these studies ranged from 25.6 months to 156 months. The ranges of 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates were 72%-100%, 55%-96%, 59%-96%, 52%-96%, and 55%-96%, respectively. The overall complication rate ranged from 2%-15%, and the total perioperative mortality were from 0 to 7%. CONCLUSION: HIPC after CRS is effective and safe for patients with PMP.			2011				2149
Ciprofloxacin use in neonates: a systematic review of the literature		Kaguelidou, F., Turner, M. A., Choonara, I. and Jacqz-Aigrain, E.				the pediatric infectious disease journal	the pediatric infectious disease journal	BACKGROUND: ciprofloxacin has no marketing authorization for use in neonates worldwide but it is prescribed for the treatment of neonatal life-threatening infections, mainly in developing countries and in Europe. Given the concerns about its toxicity in this population and the necessity for its use in specific clinical situations, we conducted a systematic review of the use of ciprofloxacin in neonates. METHODS: we performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and bibliographies of relevant articles. We included all studies, regardless of design, that reported efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of any neonatal infectious condition. We excluded letters, editorials, preliminary reports, and abstracts. RESULTS: observational cohort studies, case reports, and descriptions of patient series account for all literature reviewed. Ciprofloxacin was administrated in neonates as a salvage therapy for sepsis due to multidrug-resistant strains or with signs of clinical deterioration under first-line antibiotic treatment. Initial administration was always intravenous with variable dosing schedule. Clinical response to treatment was estimated at 64% and 91% in 2 cohort studies, with a median of 83% in case series. Of the 14 case reports, 12 yielded positive clinical outcomes. No serious adverse events, particularly joint toxicity, were observed, although evaluation was predominantly clinical and follow-up limited to few months after the end of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: the current literature provides some information to support the use of ciprofloxacin in neonates. Additional high quality studies should be undertaken to provide reliable data on pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and long-term safety.			2011				956
Systematic review: medical and nutritional interventions for the management of intestinal failure and its resultant complications in children		Barclay, A. R., Beattie, L. M., Weaver, L. T. and Wilson, D. C.				alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	BACKGROUND: Intestinal failure (IF) affects a growing number of children due to increasing numbers of preterm infants surviving intestinal resection for necrotising enterocolitis and improving surgical techniques for congenital gut anomalies. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is the mainstay of therapy; enteral nutrition may have trophic effects on the gut. AIM: To review systematically evidence for the effectiveness of medical and nutritional interventions in the treatment of IF in children. METHODS: Retrieval of data from studies of patients aged <18 years and receiving >28 days of PN. Outcome measures were improvement in intestinal function, intestinal adaptation, growth, prevention and treatment of IF-associated liver disease, and mortality. Cochrane Database (November 2009), MEDLINE (1950-November 2009) and CINAHL (1982-November 2009) electronic database searches were made using keyword and subject headings (MeSH): IF, Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS), PN and Child. The level of the evidence (EL) was assessed using SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) methodology (http://www.sign.ac.uk). RESULTS: From 1 607 620 hits, 720 abstracts were reviewed. Thirty-three original articles were included. No studies were of high methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence base for medical and nutritional interventions in paediatric IF is limited and of poor quality. In the absence of randomised-controlled trials, this evidence base can improve through case control and cohort research; and with better multiagency communication, the study of inter-centre differences is possible. Achievable short-term goals would include the study of: optimal ursodeoxycholic usage, novel intralipid formulations, cycled enteral antibiotics, enteral probiotics and new enteral feeding strategies.			2011				1930
Therapeutic Options in the Management of Sleep Disorders in Visually Impaired Children: A Systematic Review		Khan, S. A., Heussler, H., McGuire, T., Dakin, C., Pache, D., Norris, R., Cooper, D. and Charles, B.				clinical therapeutics	clinical therapeutics	Abstract: Background: Treatment of sleep disorders in visually impaired children is complicated by a complex pathophysiology, a high incidence of sleep disorders in this population, and a dearth of management options. The significant impact on the health of these children and distress to their caregivers warrant a systematic assessment of the published literature on therapeutic approaches. Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the current therapeutic options in the management of sleep disorders in visually impaired children to identify knowledge gaps and guide future research. Methods: A search of primary literature was conducted using the bibliographic databases PubMed (1980August 2010), EMBASE (1990August 2010), Science Citation Index Expanded (1990August 2010), and CINHAL (1992August 2010) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Additional studies were identified through snowballing search techniques (manually by searching retrieved references and electronically by using citation-tracking software). Search terms included behavioral treatment, children, circadian rhythm, hypnosedatives, intellectual disability, light therapy, melatonin, phototherapy, random allocation, randomized controlled trial (RCT), sleep disorder, and visual impairment. Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials of therapeutic options (behavioral treatment, light therapy, melatonin, or hypnosedatives) used in participants aged 3 months to 18 years who had both a visual impairment and a sleep disorder were included. Independent extraction of articles was performed by 2 authors using predefined data fields, including quality of the therapeutic options, based on the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy evidence-rating system. Results: Two RCTs were retrieved for melatonin, with improved effect on sleep latency (P = 0.019 and P < 0.05, respectively). However, separate analysis for visual impairment was not conducted. No RCTs were retrieved for behavioral intervention, light therapy, or hypnosedatives. Three studies using behavioral therapy (2 case reports and 1 case series) anecdotally showed improvement in sleep habit. No improvement in sleep rhythm was observed with a case series applying light therapy as an intervention. Conclusions: Children with visual impairment and sleep disorders are a heterogeneous patient group, making diagnosis and treatment difficult. RCTs on treatment options remain in their infancy, with a lack of evidence for appropriate therapeutic strategies. Trials across a range of selected diagnoses need to be conducted with adequate sample populations to differentiate the efficacy of 4 different treatment modalities (behavioral therapy, light therapy, melatonin, and hypnosedatives) as agents for improving sleep.			2011				1335
Pharmacological treatment of insomnia in alcohol recovery: a systematic review		Kolla, B. P., Mansukhani, M. P. and Schneekloth, T.				alcohol and alcoholism (oxford, oxfordshire)	alcohol and alcoholism (oxford, oxfordshire)	AIMS: To conduct a systematic review of pharmacological agents used to treat sleep problems in alcohol recovery. METHODS: In accordance with the Quorum statement, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Psych Info and Medline databases using the terms alcohol, insomnia/sleep and treatment/management with no year/language restrictions. RESULTS: The search revealed 1239 articles and 20 met inclusion criteria. Trazodone was compared against placebo and found to be superior in two trials. Trazodone and gabapentin improved sleep measures with gabapentin performing significantly better in an open-label study. The data regarding gabapentin are equivocal with few studies showing a clear benefit. In one randomized trial, topiramate resulted in improved subjective sleep measures and a reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days. Two randomized control trials of carbamazepine revealed improvement in subjective sleep measures. A randomized study showed lormetazepam was better than zopiclone on some measures. In a small placebo-controlled trial, acamprosate was found to result in improvements on some sleep measures. In single, small, mostly open-label studies, quetiapine, triazolam, ritanserin, bright light and magnesium have shown efficacy, while chlormethiazole, scopolamine and melperone showed no difference or worsening. CONCLUSION: Trazodone has the most data suggesting efficacy. This finding is tempered by a study suggesting its association with a return to heavy drinking in some patients. Data regarding the efficacy of gabapentin are unclear at this point.			2011				1010
Insulin glargine use during pregnancy		Pantalone, K. M., Faiman, C. and Olansky, L.				endocrine practice : official journal of the american college of endocrinology and the american association of clinical endocrinologists	endocrine practice : official journal of the american college of endocrinology and the american association of clinical endocrinologists	OBJECTIVE: To review the literature regarding the use of insulin glargine during pregnancy, specifically addressing the issues and concerns surrounding mitogenicity, placental transfer, and maternal and fetal safety. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search using MEDLINE and BIOSIS Previews up to March 2011. Additional studies were identified by hand-searching reference lists from original articles. Inclusion was limited to studies and abstracts in the English language. RESULTS: A total of 23 reports with 1001 pregnancies managed with insulin glargine contained relevant information regarding the maternal and fetal safety of its use during pregnancy. Insulin glargine does not appear to have enhanced mitogenic activity when compared with the mitogenic activity of native human insulin. The transplacental transfer of insulin glargine appears to be negligible, although it is possible that antibody-bound insulin glargine may gain access to the fetal compartment. The available data suggest that there are no identifiable, consistent adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with the use of insulin glargine during pregnancy, including during the first trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Use of insulin glargine during pregnancy should be seriously considered in uncontrolled diabetes during pregnancy and in those patients taking insulin glargine before conception, because the benefits from improved glycemic control would be expected to outweigh any, as yet, unproven risks of insulin glargine exposure.			2011				2353
The use of foot orthoses in the management of the rheumatoid arthritis patient		Oishi, Atsushi, Prior, Mathew, Worley, Anthea and Funabashi Orthopaedic Hospital, Nishifuna Clinic Funabashi Chiba				internet journal of allied health sciences & practice	internet journal of allied health sciences & practice	Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune condition of unclear aetiology. Foot problems, including pain, deformity and functional limitation, are common amongst patients. Despite orthotic intervention being common in rheumatoid arthritis, there is reportedly limited and conflicting evidence for its effectiveness. The aim of this review is to identify and evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of foot orthoses in the management of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant literature pertaining to the use of orthoses in the management of the rheumatic foot. Fifteen articles, comprising both primary and secondary evidence, were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Their methodological quality varied, but was generally good. Most interventions described reported beneficial effects on pain and function, using pre- and post-intervention measures or through comparisons with placebos. There were few studies that directly compared the effectiveness of different foot orthoses interventions (such as hard, soft, semi-rigid) in the management of rheumatoid arthritis of the foot. Clinical recommendations are difficult to make without this comparative data. The most appropriate foot orthoses may also be dependent on the type and level of foot deformity present from rheumatoid arthritis. Further research is recommended to identify appropriate orthotic interventions for different clinical scenarios.			2011				2204
Oral cyclosporin in psoriasis: a systematic review on treatment modalities, risk of kidney toxicity and evidence for use in non-plaque psoriasis		Maza, A., Montaudié, H., Sbidian, E., Gallini, A., Aractingi, S., Aubin, F., Bachelez, H., Cribier, B., Joly, P., Jullien, D., Le Maître, M., Misery, L., Richard, M. A., Ortonne, J. P. and Paul, C.				journal of the european academy of dermatology and venereology : jeadv	journal of the european academy of dermatology and venereology : jeadv	BACKGROUND: Although cyclosporin (CyA) has been in use in psoriasis for more than 20 years, there is still controversy regarding treatment strategy, monitoring of kidney function and utility in non-plaque psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: To prepare for evidence-based recommendations concerning the practical use of CyA in psoriasis, we performed a systematic review to better define treatment strategy, risk of kidney toxicity and evidence for use in non-plaque psoriasis. METHODS: A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases, using the key-words 'psoriasis', 'CyA', 'nephrotoxicity' during the period from 1980 to June 2010. RESULTS: The initial literature search identified 428 articles. The final selection included 16 randomized controlled trials (RCT) for treatment strategy, 25 articles (histological studies and RCT) for risk of kidney toxicity and 10 articles (RCT, prospective studies and case series) for use in non-plaque psoriasis. Higher doses of CyA of 5 mg/kg produced Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75 response in between 50 and 97% of patients, whereas lower doses of 2.5 mg/kg yielded PASI 75 in between 28 and 85%. CyA could maintain remission at doses of at least 3 mg/kg/day. Low calory diet in obese patients was shown to improve CyA efficacy. More than 50% of the patients treated with CyA may have an increase in serum creatinin value over 30% of baseline if treatment is prolonged for 2 years. CyA at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day was effective for 89% of patients with palmoplantar pustulosis. More than 50% of the patients with erythrodermic psoriasis obtained a significant improvement at doses between 3 and 5 mg/kg/day at 2-4 months. CyA was more effective than etretinate on nail psoriasis. CONCLUSION: Oral CyA is indicated for patients with plaque psoriasis, pustular psoriasis or erythrodermic psoriasis. The starting dose of 5 mg/kg is associated with a higher degree of clearance. The benefit-risk appears to be better for patients without risk factors for nephrotoxicity: non-obese patients without hypertension and aged below 60. Although CyA is ideally suited for crisis intervention, continuous maintenance treatment with CyA may be envisaged in some patients provided serum creatinin is regularly monitored and the cumulative treatment duration is preferably limited to 2 years or less.			2011				1579
Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for sepsis: a meta-analysis		Bo, L., Wang, F., Zhu, J., Li, J. and Deng, X.				critical care (london, england)	critical care (london, england)	INTRODUCTION: To investigate the effects of G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy in non-neutropenic patients with sepsis. METHODS: A systematic literature search of Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted using specific search terms. A manual review of references was also performed. Eligible studies were randomized control trials (RCTs) that compared granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) therapy with placebo for the treatment of sepsis in adults. Main outcome measures were all-cause mortality at 14 days and 28 days after initiation of G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy, in-hospital mortality, reversal rate from infection, and adverse events. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs with 2,380 patients were identified. In regard to 14-day mortality, a total of 9 death events occurred among 71 patients (12.7%) in the treatment group compared with 13 events among 67 patients (19.4%) in the placebo groups. Meta-analysis showed there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality when G-CSF or GM-CSF were compared with placebo (relative risks (RR) = 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 to 1.11, P = 0.44; P for heterogeneity = 0.31, I2 = 15%). Compared with placebo, G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy did not significantly reduce in-hospital mortality (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.36, P = 0.86; P for heterogeneity = 0.80, I2 = 0%). However, G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy significantly increased the reversal rate from infection (RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.62, P = 0.002; P for heterogeneity = 0.47, I2 = 0%). No significant difference was observed in adverse events between groups (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.23, P = 0.62; P for heterogeneity = 0.03, I2 = 58%). Sensitivity analysis by excluding one trial did not significantly change the results of adverse events (RR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.32, P = 0.44; P for heterogeneity = 0.17, I2 = 36%). CONCLUSIONS: There is no current evidence supporting the routine use of G-CSF or GM-CSF in patients with sepsis. Large prospective multicenter clinical trials investigating monocytic HLA-DR (mHLA-DR)-guided G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy in patients with sepsis-associated immunosuppression are warranted.			2011				2565
Medical, psychological, and sociodemographic factors associated with adherence to cardiac rehabilitation programs: a systematic review		Taylor, G. H., Wilson, S. L. and Sharp, J.				the journal of cardiovascular nursing	the journal of cardiovascular nursing	OBJECTIVES: : Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity rates among coronary heart disease patients, but adherence to these classes has been found to be poor. This review aims to summarize and integrate research findings investigating the possible sociodemographic, medical, and psychological variables that influence patient adherence to CR programs. It also aims to address the methodological failings of past reviews conducted in this area. METHODS: : Several databases were systematically searched for studies published between 1990 and 2009. Studies examining CR program adherence or completion, using data based on participant's actual recorded attendance were included. RESULTS: : Eighteen studies were identified that met inclusion criteria. Low mood, participant's age, and certain cardiac risk factors were found to be most consistently associated with poor adherence to CR. A good understanding of the consequences of heart disease was found to be associated with good adherence. Results were relatively inconsistent across studies because of differences in methods used. CONCLUSIONS: : Certain risk factors for poor adherence to CR should be assessed and monitored by health professionals. Future studies should address the methodological difficulties present in previous research. Recommendations are made for standardizing methods in future research.			2011				1807
Gait modification strategies for altering medial knee joint load: a systematic review		Simic, M., Hinman, R. S., Wrigley, T. V., Bennell, K. L. and Hunt, M. A.				arthritis care & research	arthritis care & research	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of gait modification strategies on the external knee adduction moment (KAM), a marker of medial knee joint load; determine potentially adverse effects; assess the methodologic quality; and identify areas of future research. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched. Studies evaluating the effects of gait modifications on the KAM in either healthy individuals or those with knee osteoarthritis (OA) were included. Methodologic quality was evaluated by 2 reviewers using the Downs and Black checklist. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, exploring 14 different gait modifications of varying sample sizes, age groups, and OA classifications. Contralateral cane use, increased step width, medial knee thrust, increased hip internal rotation, weight transfer to the medial foot, and increased lateral trunk lean demonstrated KAM reductions. Tai Chi gait, ipsilateral cane use, Nordic walking poles, and increased knee flexion exhibited increases in the KAM, demonstrating a potential detriment to their use. The effects of reduced stride length, as well as increases and reductions in either toe-out or gait speed, were inconsistent across the studies and gait cycle. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates that some gait modifications have the ability to alter knee load. Future research is required to determine the magnitude of modification required to maximize beneficial effects, the best method of training, long-term patient adherence, and if these biomechanical changes can translate into clinically relevant changes in symptoms or disease progression risk.			2011				1856
What research evidence is there for the use of art therapy in the management of symptoms in adults with cancer? A systematic review		Wood, M. J., Molassiotis, A. and Payne, S.				psycho-oncology	psycho-oncology	Objective: Common psychosocial difficulties experienced by cancer patients are fatigue, depression, anxiety, and existential and relational concerns. Art therapy is one intervention being developed to address these difficulties. The purpose of this research was to assess and synthesize the available research evidence for the use of art therapy in the management of symptoms in adults with cancer. Methods: A literature search of electronic databases, 'grey' literature, hand searching of key journals, and personal contacts was undertaken. Keywords searched were 'art therapy' and 'cancer' or 'neoplasm'. The inclusion criteria were: research studies of any design; adult cancer population; and art therapy intervention. There were no language or date restrictions. Data extraction occurred and quality appraisal was undertaken. Data were analyzed using narrative synthesis. Results: Fourteen papers reporting 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Symptoms investigated spanned emotional, physical, social and global functioning, and existential/spiritual concerns. Measures used were questionnaires, in-depth interviews, patients' artwork, therapists' narratives of sessions, and stress markers in salivary samples. No overall effect size was determined owing to heterogeneity of studies. Narrative synthesis of the studies shows art therapy is used at all stages of the cancer trajectory, most frequently by women, the most common cancer site in participants being breast. Conclusion: Art therapy is a psychotherapeutic approach that is being used by adults with cancer to manage a spectrum of treatment-related symptoms and facilitate the process of psychological readjustment to the loss, change, and uncertainty characteristic of cancer survivorship. Research in this area is still in its infancy. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.			2011				2041
A systematic review of free tissue transfer in the management of non-traumatic lower extremity wounds in patients with diabetes		Fitzgerald O'Connor, E. J., Vesely, M., Holt, P. J., Jones, K. G., Thompson, M. M. and Hinchliffe, R. J.				european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	OBJECTIVES: Wounds of the lower limb in patients with diabetes are frequently difficult to heal. Some wounds fail to heal despite optimal medical and surgical care. This review examines the evidence for whether free tissue transfer techniques may reduce the requirement of amputation in these patients. DESIGN: A systematic review. MATERIALS & METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, AMED, SCOPUS and CINAHL and Cochrane Library were searched for all articles on free tissue transfer in lower limb wounds in patients with diabetes (September 2010). Current experience, indications and outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: 528 patients from 18 studies were included in the systematic review. 66% of patients had concomitant revascularisation with bypass surgery. 63% of flaps were muscle based, 35% fasciocutaneous and 1.7% omental. Pooled in-hospital mortality rate was 4.4%, flap survival was 92% and limb salvage rate of 83.4% over a 28 months average follow-up time. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion free tissue transfer achieves successful wound healing in selected patients with diabetes and difficult to heal wounds that would have required amputation. Pre-operative optimisation of vascular supply and eradication of infection is key to success. Objective wound assessment scores and a clear multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach would improve patient care.			2011				1258
Antenatal depression: a rationale for studying exercise		Shivakumar, G., Brandon, A. R., Snell, P. G., Santiago-Muñoz, P., Johnson, N. L., Trivedi, M. H. and Freeman, M. P.				depression and anxiety	depression and anxiety	BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) in pregnancy or antenatal depression poses unique treatment challenges and has serious consequences for mothers, unborn babies, and families when untreated. This review presents current knowledge on exercise during pregnancy, antidepressant effects of exercise, and the rationale for the specific study of exercise for antenatal depression. METHOD: A systematic literature review was performed using English language articles published in Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library from 1985 to January 2010. RESULTS: There is a broad literature supporting the antidepressant effects of exercise, but a paucity of studies specifically for antenatal depression. A small number of observational studies have reported that regular physical activities improve self-esteem and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy. To date, there have not been randomized controlled studies of exercise for the treatment of MDD in pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic studies are needed to assess exercise as a treatment alternative for MDD during pregnancy. In consideration of the benefits of exercise for the mother and baby, and the burden of depression, studies are needed to determine the role of exercise for pregnant women with depression.			2011				2131
Association between metabolic syndrome and cognitive decline: a systematic review of prospective population-based studies		Hao, Z., Wu, B., Wang, D. and Liu, M.				acta neuropsychiatrica	acta neuropsychiatrica	OBJECTIVE: The association between metabolic syndrome (MS) and the risk of cognitive impairment or dementia remains unclear. In this article, we systematically review studies on the risk of cognitive disorders in patients with MS to determine the strength of the association between MS and cognitive decline. METHODS: Electronic databases through December 2009 were searched to identify prospective population-based studies that examined the association between MS and risk of cognitive disorders. Two reviewers used a standardised form to collect data and assess eligibility. The quality of study was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: We found nine eligible studies that involve 19 876 participants. All studies but two indicate that MS is associated with cognitive decline (from one-fold to more than two-fold increase in risk). It seems that MS may be associated with cognitive impairment (positive results in three of five) and vascular dementia (positive results in two of three), whereas three studies involving patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) did not find the association between MS and AD. When examining the association of the individual risk factors of the MS and cognition in seven eligible studies, glucose (three studies) and hypertension (three studies) showed positive results associated with cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: The MS may be associated with cognitive impairment and vascular dementia but not for AD, which need to be further investigated with high-quality studies.			2011				1815
Clinical effectiveness of fresh frozen plasma compared with fibrinogen concentrate: a systematic review		Kozek-Langenecker, S., Sørensen, B., Hess, J. R. and Spahn, D. R.				critical care (london, england)	critical care (london, england)	INTRODUCTION: Haemostatic therapy in surgical and/or massive trauma patients typically involves transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Purified human fibrinogen concentrate may offer an alternative to FFP in some instances. In this systematic review, we investigated the current evidence for the use of FFP and fibrinogen concentrate in the perioperative or massive trauma setting. METHODS: Studies reporting the outcome (blood loss, transfusion requirement, length of stay, survival and plasma fibrinogen level) of FFP or fibrinogen concentrate administration to patients in a perioperative or massive trauma setting were identified in electronic databases (1995 to 2010). Studies were included regardless of type, patient age, sample size or duration of patient follow-up. Studies of patients with congenital clotting factor deficiencies or other haematological disorders were excluded. Studies were assessed for eligibility, and data were extracted and tabulated. RESULTS: Ninety-one eligible studies (70 FFP and 21 fibrinogen concentrate) reported outcomes of interest. Few were high-quality prospective studies. Evidence for the efficacy of FFP was inconsistent across all assessed outcomes. Overall, FFP showed a positive effect for 28% of outcomes and a negative effect for 22% of outcomes. There was limited evidence that FFP reduced mortality: 50% of outcomes associated FFP with reduced mortality (typically trauma and/or massive bleeding), and 20% were associated with increased mortality (typically surgical and/or nonmassive bleeding). Five studies reported the outcome of fibrinogen concentrate versus a comparator. The evidence was consistently positive (70% of all outcomes), with no negative effects reported (0% of all outcomes). Fibrinogen concentrate was compared directly with FFP in three high-quality studies and was found to be superior for > 50% of outcomes in terms of reducing blood loss, allogeneic transfusion requirements, length of intensive care unit and hospital stay and increasing plasma fibrinogen levels. We found no fibrinogen concentrate comparator studies in patients with haemorrhage due to massive trauma, although efficacy across all assessed outcomes was reported in a number of noncomparator trauma studies. CONCLUSIONS: The weight of evidence does not appear to support the clinical effectiveness of FFP for surgical and/or massive trauma patients and suggests it can be detrimental. Perioperatively, fibrinogen concentrate was generally associated with improved outcome measures, although more high-quality, prospective studies are required before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.			2011				1412
Systematic Review of Interventions Aimed at Nurses to Improve Pain Management		Gunnarsdóttir, Sigriur, Grétarsdóttir, Elfa öll and University of, Iceland				nordic journal of nursing research & clinical studies / vård i norden	nordic journal of nursing research & clinical studies / vård i norden	Aim: The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview and evaluation of experimental studies, testing the efficacy of interventions aimed at nurses, or the multidisciplinary health care team, to improve pain management. Background: Pain is a prevalent problem, and has been found to be inadequately assessed, documented and managed. Barriers to pain management have been identified at multiple levels, including the systems level, among health care professionals and among patients and their family members. Continuing education and training aimed at nurses and other health care professionals has been a commonly used strategy to improve pain management. Methods: Computer searches were conducted to identify experimental studies, either randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi experiments with a control group, where the efficacy of interventions aimed at nurses or the multidisciplinary health care team, to improve pain management were tested. Articles were included if they were published between 1990 and 2010. Findings: Few experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of continuing educational programs aimed at health care professionals to improve pain management. Eleven studies were found that fit the inclusion criteria, nine RCTs and two quasi experiments with control groups. The patient populations, settings, target of the interventions, content, delivery method and duration varied greatly, as did outcome measures. In only six studies, effects on patient outcomes were reported. Three interventions were found to positively affect clinical patient outcomes; a brief, focused intervention aimed at staff nurses with individualized feedback, a comprehensive intervention utilizing role models to implement change plus an implementation of an evidence based pain algorithm; and a comprehensive intervention with over 30 hours of education aimed at nursing staff. Conclusion: In only a few studies, the effects of continuing education programs to improve pain management have been assessed, and in only a handful of studies, direct patient outcomes have been measured. Continuing education programs are both time consuming and costly. Since they are among the most used strategies to improve pain management in health care settings, it is vital to test their efficacy in randomized controlled trials, to identify their key components and to test their effects on direct patient outcomes.			2011				1700
Stent-assisted coiling in acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms: a qualitative, systematic review of the literature		Bodily, K. D., Cloft, H. J., Lanzino, G., Fiorella, D. J., White, P. M. and Kallmes, D. F.				ajnr. american journal of neuroradiology	ajnr. american journal of neuroradiology	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The use of stents for treatment of morphologically unfavorable, acutely ruptured aneurysms is avoided by most operators because of concerns about the risk of using dual antiplatelet therapy in the setting of acute SAH. Our aim was to review the literature regarding stent-assisted coil embolization of acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms to determine the safety and efficacy of this treatment option. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles including ?5 patients with ruptured aneurysms who were treated acutely with stent-assisted coiling or uncovered stent placement alone were identified. Data on clinical presentation, technical success, surgical crossover, intracranial complications, and clinical outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 17 articles were identified reporting 339 patients who met inclusion criteria. Among 212 patients with available data, technical success was noted in 198 (93%) patients. Three hundred twenty-six (96%) of 339 patients received both heparin during the procedure and dual-antiplatelet therapy during or immediately postprocedure. One hundred thirty (63%) of 207 aneurysms were completely occluded. Six (2%) of 339 patients required surgical crossover, usually for failure in stent placement or for intraprocedural aneurysm rupture. Clinically significant intracranial hemorrhagic complications occurred in 27 (8%) of 339 patients, including 9 (10%) of 90 patients known to have EVDs who had ventricular drain-related hemorrhages. Clinically significant thromboembolic events occurred in 16 (6%) of 288 patients. Sixty-seven percent of patients had favorable clinical outcomes, 14% had poor outcomes, and 19% died. CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted coiling in ruptured aneurysms can be performed with high degrees of technical success, but adverse events appear more common and clinical outcomes are likely worse than those achieved without stent assistance. Thromboembolic complications appear reasonably well-controlled. Reported EVD-related hemorrhagic complications were uncommon, though the total number of EVDs placed was unknown.			2011				1767
Strategies for managing carious lesions in patients with disabilities -- a systematic review		Molina, G. F., Leal, S. C., Frencken, J. E. and Department of Dental Materials, Dental Faculty National University of Cordoba Cordoba Argentina				journal of disability & oral health	journal of disability & oral health	Caries may constitute an additional problem to people with disabilities. Individuals' physical and intellectual impairments as well as insufficient availability of appropriate services are addressed as barriers to oral health care in this population. The present study aimed to determine the current strategies applied for the prevention and treatment of dental caries in people with special needs by means of a systematic review of dental literature. Three databases were searched from January 1991 up to 1 February 2011. Randomised clinical trials, case-control, cohort studies and systematic reviews on preventive or restorative programmes related to dental caries in people with disabilities, published in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French and German languages were included for analysis. Only eight papers met the inclusion criteria; five referring to caries preventive, and three to restorative care programmes. Owing to the heterogeneity, quality, number, types and outcomes of the studies included in this review, it was not possible to extract a common strategy for the prevention and treatment of dental caries in people with disabilities. In light of the urgent need for such strategies for this population, it is suggested that international associations dealing with the production of scientific evidence, and those related to disability and oral health, must promote the development of quality research in order to propose guidelines for the prevention and treatment of dental caries in people with disabilities.			2011				1100
Lower gastrointestinal perforation in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with conventional DMARDs or tocilizumab: a systematic literature review		Gout, T., Ostör, A. J. and Nisar, M. K.				clinical rheumatology	clinical rheumatology	Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor, has recently been added to the therapeutic armamentarium against rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite its overall safety, concerns have been raised regarding diverticular perforation in patients receiving the drug. The aim of our research was to document the incidence of diverticular disease in RA patients treated in the pre-disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) era, following treatment with conventional DMARDs, and subsequent to tocilizumab therapy. We performed a systematic literature review in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Current Controlled Trials up to Nov. 2010. The publication titles and abstracts were independently assessed by two reviewers for relevance and quality, and the review was conducted following guidelines from the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. In the pre-DMARD period of RA management, where patients were largely treated with NSAIDs and corticosteroids, gastrointestinal (GI) complications were a substantial cause of mortality with diverticulitis and colonic ulcers accounting for almost a third of GI-related deaths. In contrast, our search did not reveal any evidence of diverticular perforation in patients treated with conventional DMARDs. Eighteen cases of lower GI perforation (16 of whom had diverticulitis) have been documented in recent conference proceedings following tocilizumab treatment in clinical trials, with a lower GI perforation rate of 1.9 per 1,000 patient years (PY). This lies between the reported rate of GI perforations for corticosteroids and anti-TNF-? agents in the United Health Care database, with rates of 3.9 per 1,000 PY (95% CI 3.1-4.8) and 1.3 per 1,000 PY (95% CI 0.8-1.9), respectively. The majority of these patients were concurrently prescribed NSAIDs and/or long-term corticosteroids. Traditional DMARD therapy for RA appears not only to have modified the risk of lower GI perforation but prevented it. The risk of diverticular perforation may be slightly higher in patients treated with tocilizumab compared with conventional DMARDs or anti-TNF agents, but lower than that for corticosteroids. The mechanism of action of IL-6 antagonism in the pathophysiology of diverticular perforation has yet to be elucidated.			2011				1504
Perioperative steroids for minimizing edema and ecchymosis after rhinoplasty: a meta-analysis		Hatef, D. A., Ellsworth, W. A., Allen, J. N., Bullocks, J. M., Hollier, L. H. and Stal, S.				aesthetic surgery journal / the american society for aesthetic plastic surgery	aesthetic surgery journal / the american society for aesthetic plastic surgery	BACKGROUND: Minimizing complications after rhinoplasty is a priority for every surgeon performing the procedure. Perioperative steroid administration has been shown to decrease postoperative edema and ecchymosis in a number of prospective randomized trials. OBJECTIVES: In an effort to further elucidate the significance of the data and develop an evidence-based algorithm for steroid administration, the authors offer a meta-analysis of the existing literature. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed. All articles were reviewed for relevant data, which were extracted, pooled, and compared. Seven prospective randomized trials investigating perioperative steroid use in rhinoplasty have been conducted and reported. Four of these studies had the same method of patient edema and ecchymosis assessment, and their data were compared. RESULTS: Based on results from the four relevant studies, perioperative steroid use significantly reduces postoperative edema and ecchymosis of the upper and lower eyelids at one day and seven days postoperatively (P < .0001). Preoperative steroid administration decreases postoperative upper and lower eyelid edema at one day preoperatively, when compared to postoperative administration (P < .05). Extended dosing is superior to one-time dosing (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative steroid use decreases postoperative edema and ecchymosis associated with rhinoplasty. Preoperative administration is superior to postoperative, and extended dosing is superior to singular. Based on these results, evidence-based guidelines for perioperative steroid administration can be given.			2011				2385
[Uterus preserving surgery versus vaginal hysterectomy in treatment of uterine descent: a systematic review]		Detollenaere, R. J., den Boon, J., Vierhout, M. E. and van Eijndhoven, H. W.				nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde	nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde	OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of uterus preserving procedures and vaginal hysterectomy in treatment of uterine prolapse. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHOD: We searched in Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and the reference lists of relevant publications for articles comparing uterus preserving procedures with vaginal hysterectomy. The following outcome measures were studied: anatomical result, subjective outcome regarding prolapse symptoms, micturition, defecation and sexual function, quality of life, duration of surgery, duration of hospital stay, amount of blood loss, complications and postoperative recovery. RESULTS: We found one systematic review, one randomised trial and five cohort studies, from which eight comparative studies were selected for review. There was no difference in subjective outcome after sacrospinous fixation, Manchester Fothergill procedure, abdominal hysteropexy and intravaginal slingplasty on comparison with vaginal hysterectomy. All procedures, except for sacrospinous ligament fixation, had similar anatomical outcomes to vaginal hysterectomy. With the exception of Manchester Fothergill procedure hospital stay was shorter after uterus preservation. The quality of most of the studies was poor, with only small numbers of patients included and short-term follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Although some uterus preserving procedures are associated with shorter operation time, shorter duration of hospital stay and less blood loss than vaginal hysterectomy, based on the current literature there is no clear preference for either uterus preserving surgery or hysterectomy in surgical treatment of uterine descent, since randomised trials of sufficient quality are lacking. Prospective clinical randomised trials with long term follow-up are needed to investigate the value of uterine preserving procedures.			2011				1054
Efficacy and safety of intraoperative radiotherapy in colorectal cancer: a systematic review		Cantero-Muñoz, P., Urién, M. A. and Ruano-Ravina, A.				cancer letters	cancer letters	Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) has been proposed as an encouraging treatment for colorectal cancer. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of IORT for this cancer through a systematic review. Studies located in electronic databases were selected according to established criteria, read and analysed and the results extracted by two independent reviewers. Fifteen studies met the selection criteria. Five-to-six-year local control (LC) was over 80% and 5-year overall survival (OS) was close to 65%. For recurrences, the 5-year overall survival was 30%. The main acute complications were gastrointestinal. Adding IORT to conventional treatment reduces the incidence of local recurrences within the radiation area over 10%. IORT is a safe technique as it does not increase toxicity associated with conventional treatment.			2011				1130
Brow lift in facial rejuvenation: a systematic literature review of open versus endoscopic techniques		Graham, D. W., Heller, J., Kurkjian, T. J., Kirkjian, T. J., Schaub, T. S. and Rohrich, R. J.				plastic and reconstructive surgery	plastic and reconstructive surgery	BACKGROUND: Currently, there are many well-described surgical approaches to address brow aesthetics (i.e., open versus endoscopic versus combination techniques). Each technique has associated benefits and limitations. The authors' discussion in this article is intended to review current worldwide surgical approaches to brow aesthetics and to explore the following question: Are open brow lifts still pertinent in the modern era of cosmetic surgery? METHODS: A systematic review of current available literature for the dates 1992 until the present was performed using the MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAWL databases. Inclusion criteria required that individual studies contain original content; provide patient outcome data, including complications; and maintain a sufficient sample size of no fewer than 20 patients. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine articles were reviewed from the initial keyword searches of four major databases and plastic surgery journals. Fifteen articles were included in the analysis after careful review established that the necessary criteria were met. From direct analysis of these articles, no clear evidence exists to indicate that open methods of brow surgery are inferior to endoscopic approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Brow-lift surgery has clearly evolved since the inception of endoscopic techniques in the early 1990s. However, currently there are no prospective randomized trials in the literature that compare the surgical outcomes of differing approaches. This thorough review of current worldwide English-language literature highlights the relative paucity of good comparative studies and serves as a reminder that there is still an important role for the open approach to brow aesthetic dilemmas.

Electrical stimulation for lower urinary tract dysfunction in children: a systematic review of the literature		Barroso, U., Tourinho, R., Lordêlo, P., Hoebeke, P. and Chase, J.				neurourology and urodynamics	neurourology and urodynamics	AIMS: To review studies using electrical neural stimulation (ENS), to treat children with non-neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunctions (LUTD), and to establish the efficacy of this treatment. METHODS: This review was based on an electronic search of the MEDLINE database and the Cochrane Central Search library, from January 1990 to March 2010. INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) participants aged 0-17 years, (2) participants with a diagnosis of LUTD not related to congenital abnormalities or neurological disease, (3) English language, and (4) treatment by ENS. RESULTS: Seventeen papers were evaluated. Type of ENS varied among studies: sacral transcutaneous ENS in seven, sacral implanted device in four, posterior tibial percutaneous in three, and anogenital, endoanal, and intravesical in one each. There were two randomized clinical trials. Clarity regarding the LUTD being treated was variable. The populations studied were not homogeneous. The duration of treatment and the number of sessions a week were variable among the studies. Electrical parameters used also varied. A range of subjective and objective measures was used to measure treatment success. Rates of complete resolution of the symptoms of OAB, urgency, and daytime incontinence ranged from 31% to 86% [Trsinar and Kraij, Neurourol Urodyn 15: 133-42, 1996; Hagstroem et al., J Urol 182: 2072-8, 2009], 25% to 84% [Hoebeke et al., J Urol 168: 2605-8, 2002; Lordêlo et al., J Urol 182: 2900-4, 2009], 13% to 84% [Malm-Buatsi et al., Urology 70: 980-3, 2007; Lordêlo et al., J Urol 184: 683-9, 2010], respectively. For sacral transcutaneous ENS recurrence ranged from 10% to 25%. Apart from the sacral implantation studies, any reported side effects were mild and transitory. CONCLUSIONS: The literature in the area of interest is sparse. Parasacral TENS has been shown to be more effective than sham in randomized trials in treating OAB. This deserves further research to elucidate the optimal parameters and the children for whom it is most useful.			2011				1748
Health effects of mixed fruit and vegetable concentrates: a systematic review of the clinical interventions		Esfahani, A., Wong, J. M., Truan, J., Villa, C. R., Mirrahimi, A., Srichaikul, K. and Kendall, C. W.				journal of the american college of nutrition	journal of the american college of nutrition	Diets rich in fruits and vegetables (FV) have been associated with a reduced risk of chronic disease, including cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, public health campaigns to increase FV intake have had limited success. A number of mixed concentrated FV products have been studied, which may help certain individuals improve nutrient status. However, the possible health benefits of FV supplements have not been systematically reviewed. We, therefore, undertook a systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify clinical interventions that examined the effect of commercially available concentrated mixed FV supplements on cardiovascular disease risk factors. Twenty-two reports, which used commercially available products, were identified. None of the studies reported any serious adverse effects. Overall, daily consumption of FV supplements significantly increased serum concentrations of the major antioxidant provitamins and vitamins found in plant foods (?-carotene, vitamins C and E) and folate. Functional changes, such as reduced serum homocysteine and markers of protein, lipid, and DNA oxidation, were also reported; in addition, the health advantages on markers of inflammation, immunity, and endothelial function are promising. Limitations of the available studies were related to the diversity of studies conducted with respect to design and study population and the variability in the measured outcomes and assays utilized. While mixed FV supplements may serve as an efficacious complement for individuals who have difficulty achieving their daily FV intake requirement, further research on additional retail preparations is warranted. Key teaching points: Mixed fruit and vegetable supplements produced from plant foods may serve as an efficacious complement to the habitual diet in individuals who have suboptimal intake or variety of nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables. Current research indicates that fruit and vegetable concentrates significantly increase serum levels of antioxidant provitamins and vitamins (?-carotene, vitamins C and E) and folate and reduce homocysteine and markers of oxidative stress. Mechanistic studies and larger, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trials in both healthy and high-risk populations are necessary to better understand the health effects of these supplements.			2011				1859
Penile prosthesis surgery in patients with corporal fibrosis: a state of the art review		Martínez-Salamanca, J. I., Mueller, A., Moncada, I., Carballido, J. and Mulhall, J. P.				the journal of sexual medicine	the journal of sexual medicine	"INTRODUCTION: Penile prosthesis has become one of the most accepted treatment options in patients who do not respond to conservative medical therapies (oral or intracavernous injections). When penile fibrosis is present, this surgery becomes a real surgical challenge even for a skillful surgeon. AIM: The aim of this study was to review latest techniques to implant a penile prosthesis in patients with corporal fibrosis. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, SCOPUS, and Science Citation Index without any date limits for the terms: ""penile prosthesis,""penile fibrosis,""impotence,""fibrosis,""cavernotomes,""downsized prosthesis cylinders,""patient satisfaction,""penile graft,"" and ""vascular graft."" MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We reported in each technique and series data regarding penile size, complication rate, infection rate, technical pitfalls and details, use of additional surgical tools or implanted material (grafts, etc.), patients' satisfaction, and overall success rate. RESULTS: When penile corporal fibrosis is present, this surgery becomes a real surgical challenge even for a skillful surgeon. Over the years, multiple surgical approaches have been suggested to facilitate implantation in this difficult situation. Traditional approaches include the resection of scar tissue, performing extensive corporotomies and the eventually use of grafts to cover the corporal gap. Outcomes can be improved combining the use of techniques for scar incision (extensive wide excision, multiple incisions minimizing excision, corporal counter incisions, corporal excavation technique or Shaeer's technique) and cavernotomes and downsized prosthesis. Surgical strategies like upsizing prosthesis, suspensory ligament release or scrotoplasty must be kept in mind to utilize in this special scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Penile prosthesis in a patient with severe corporal fibrosis remains a surgical challenge. There are several techniques and surgical strategies that an implant surgeon should know and manage to minimize complications and improve outcomes."			2011				2498
The effect of platelet concentrates on graft maturation and graft-bone interface healing in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in human patients: a systematic review of controlled trials		Vavken, P., Sadoghi, P. and Murray, M. M.				arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the arthroscopy association of north america and the international arthroscopy association	arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the arthroscopy association of north america and the international arthroscopy association	PURPOSE: To systematically review the current evidence for the effects of platelet concentrates on (1) graft maturation and (2) graft-bone interface healing in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in human, controlled trials and for ensuing differences in clinical outcomes. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed for controlled trials of human ACL reconstruction with and without platelet concentrates. Data validity was assessed, and data were collected on graft maturation, graft-bone interface healing, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies reported on graft maturation with significantly better outcomes in the platelet groups in 4, and there were large differences in means in an additional 2 studies. Five studies reported on tunnel healing, and 4 found no difference between groups. Three studies assessed clinical outcome but found no differences, regardless of whether they had shown a beneficial effect (1 of 3) or no effect (2 of 3) of platelets on graft and tunnel healing. CONCLUSIONS: The current best evidence suggests that the addition of platelet concentrates to ACL reconstruction may have a beneficial effect on graft maturation and could improve it by 20% to 30% on average, but with substantial variability. The most likely mode of action is that treatment with platelets accelerates graft repopulation and remodeling, and this interpretation is supported by the existing data and is biologically plausible. However, the current evidence also shows only a very limited influence of platelet concentrates on graft-bone interface healing and no significant difference in clinical outcomes.

Role of the laparoscopic approach to biliary bypass for benign and malignant biliary diseases: a systematic review		Toumi, Z., Aljarabah, M. and Ammori, B. J.				surgical endoscopy	surgical endoscopy	BACKGROUND: The laparoscopic approach for biliary bypass surgery is a contemporary management option. This article reviews the evidence available for its role and effectiveness. METHODS: A computerised search was made of the MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE databases for English language publications from the first report of laparoscopic biliary bypass in 1992 to January 2010. RESULTS: Some 89 patients featured in 19 reports underwent 89 laparoscopic biliary bypass procedures for benign (n=17) and malignant (n=72) indications. Of those, 52 patients underwent biliary bypass alone, while 37 patients underwent biliary bypass combined with gastric bypass. The procedures included cholecystojejunostomy (n=64), hepaticojejunostomy (n=14), and choledochoduodenostomy (n=11). The overall success rate in achieving resolution of jaundice was 98.9%, with a morbidity rate of 12.3% and a mortality rate of 5.6%. More than one procedure was required in 1.1% of patients to achieve resolution of obstructive jaundice. During a reported median follow-up period of 13 months, obstructive jaundice recurred in none of the patients. CONCLUSION: The laparoscopic approach to biliary bypass surgery is safe and has a high initial success rate, low reintervention rate, and low morbidity and mortality rates. Longer follow-up data and comparative studies with open surgery and endoscopic stenting are needed.			2011				1983
Effectiveness of Interventions to Prevent Falls in People With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias		Jensen, L. E. and Padilla, R.				the american journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the american occupational therapy association	the american journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the american occupational therapy association	A systematic review was conducted to determine the effectiveness of interventions to prevent falls in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. Twelve research reports met inclusion criteria. Studies reported on three types of intervention: (1) exercise- and motor-based interventions, (2) nursing staff- directed interventions, and (3) multidisciplinary interventions. Strategies were offered as single or multifaceted intervention programs. All types of intervention resulted in benefit, although the evidence for effectiveness is tentative because of the studies' limitations. More research is needed to better understand appropriate dosages of intervention. No evidence was found for the effectiveness of prevention programs accessed as part of occasional respite care. Occupational therapy was seldom involved in the interventions researched. Because effective fall prevention programs are embedded in people's daily routines and encouraged participation in occupation, the contribution occupational therapy practitioners can make to the care of people with AD has yet to be fully realized.			2011				2171
A systematic review of intravenous ketamine for postoperative analgesia		Laskowski, K., Stirling, A., McKay, W. P. and Lim, H. J.				canadian journal of anaesthesia = journal canadien d'anesthésie	canadian journal of anaesthesia = journal canadien d'anesthésie	PURPOSE: Perioperative intravenous ketamine may be a useful addition in pain management regimens. Previous systematic reviews have included all methods of ketamine administration, and heterogeneity between studies has been substantial. This study addresses this issue by narrowing the inclusion criteria, using a random effects model, and performing subgroup analysis to determine the specific types of patients, surgery, and clinical indications which may benefit from perioperative ketamine administration. SOURCE: We included published studies from 1966 to 2010 which were randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled using intravenous ketamine (bolus or infusion) to decrease postoperative pain. Studies using any form of regional anesthesia were excluded. No limitation was placed on the ketamine dose, patient age, or language of publication. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ninety-one comparisons in seventy studies involving 4,701 patients met the inclusion criteria (2,652 in ketamine groups and 2,049 in placebo groups). Forty-seven of these studies were appropriate for evaluation in the core meta-analysis, and the remaining 23 studies were used to corroborate the results. A reduction in total opioid consumption and an increase in the time to first analgesic were observed across all studies (P < 0.001). The greatest efficacy was found for thoracic, upper abdominal, and major orthopedic surgical subgroups. Despite using less opioid, 25 out of 32 treatment groups (78%) experienced less pain than the placebo groups at some point postoperatively when ketamine was efficacious. This finding implies an improved quality of pain control in addition to decreased opioid consumption. Hallucinations and nightmares were more common with ketamine but sedation was not. When ketamine was efficacious for pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting was less frequent in the ketamine group. The dose-dependent role of ketamine analgesia could not be determined. CONCLUSION: Intravenous ketamine is an effective adjunct for postoperative analgesia. Particular benefit was observed in painful procedures, including upper abdominal, thoracic, and major orthopedic surgeries. The analgesic effect of ketamine was independent of the type of intraoperative opioid administered, timing of ketamine administration, and ketamine dose.			2011				1647
Effectiveness of abdominal cerclage placed via laparotomy or laparoscopy: systematic review		Burger, N. B., Brölmann, H. A., Einarsson, J. I., Langebrekke, A. and Huirne, J. A.				journal of minimally invasive gynecology	journal of minimally invasive gynecology	Preterm delivery remains a primary cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. One cause of preterm birth is cervical incompetence. In women with a shortened or absent cervix or in those in whom previous vaginal cerclage failed, abdominal cerclage may be recommended. We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database. Thirty-one eligible studies were selected. Six studies (135 patients) reported on the laparoscopic approach, and 26 (1116 patients) on the abdominal approach. Delivery of a viable infant at 34 weeks of gestation or more varied from 78.5% (laparoscopic) to 84.8% (abdominal). Second-trimester fetal loss occurred in 8.1% (laparoscopic) vs 7.8% (abdominal), with no reported third-trimester losses (laparoscopic) vs 1.2% (abdominal). We conclude that abdominal cerclage is associated with excellent results as treatment of cervical incompetence, with high fetal survival rates and minimal complications during surgery and pregnancy. Further studies are needed to differentiate which method is superior.			2011				1850
Meniscal repair versus partial meniscectomy: a systematic review comparing reoperation rates and clinical outcomes		Paxton, E. S., Stock, M. V. and Brophy, R. H.				arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the arthroscopy association of north america and the international arthroscopy association	arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the arthroscopy association of north america and the international arthroscopy association	PURPOSE: The aim of this investigation was to compare reoperation rates and clinical outcomes after meniscal repair and partial meniscectomy. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify outcome studies of arthroscopic meniscal repair (inside-out, outside-in, and all-inside techniques) or partial meniscectomy in patients with traumatic meniscal tears. The studies included patients with no previous injuries or operations. RESULTS: At short- and long-term follow-up, partial meniscectomy had a lower reoperation rate (1.4% [2 of 143] and 3.9% [52 of 1,319], respectively) than isolated meniscal repair (16.5% [47 of 284] and 20.7% [30 of 145], respectively). There was a slightly higher reoperation rate after partial lateral meniscectomy compared with partial medial meniscectomy. Repairs of the medial meniscus resulted in higher reoperation rates than repairs of the lateral meniscus. Meniscal repairs at the time of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction had a lower failure rate than isolated repairs. In the limited number of studies with long-term clinical outcome scores, meniscal repair was associated with higher Lysholm scores and less radiologic degeneration than partial meniscectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas meniscal repairs have a higher reoperation rate than partial meniscectomies, they are associated with better long-term outcomes.

The impact of health checks for people with intellectual disabilities: a systematic review of evidence		Robertson, J., Roberts, H., Emerson, E., Turner, S. and Greig, R.				journal of intellectual disability research : jidr	journal of intellectual disability research : jidr	Background Health checks for people with intellectual disabilities (ID) have been recommended as one component of health policy responses to the poorer health of people with ID. This review summarises evidence on the impact of health checks on the health and well-being of people with ID. Methods Electronic literature searches and email contacts were used to identify literature relevant to the impact of health checks for people with ID. Results A total of 38 publications were identified. These involved checking the health of over 5000 people with ID from a range of countries including a full range of people with ID. Health checks consistently led to detection of unmet health needs and targeted actions to address health needs. Conclusions Health checks are effective in identifying previously unrecognised health needs, including life-threatening conditions. Future research should consider strategies for optimising the cost-effectiveness or efficiency of health checks.			2011				1808
Effectiveness of hydrotherapy in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [Spanish]		Martín-Valero, R., Cuesta-Vargas, A. I., Labajos-Manzanares, M. and Departamento de Psiquiatría y Fisioterapia, Facultad de Enfermería Fisioterapia Podología y Terapia Ocupacional Universidad de Málaga Málaga España				rehabilitacion	rehabilitacion	Introduction The aim of this study is to detect the levels of evidence and grades of recommendation of therapeutic aquatic exercise interventions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) based on a systematic review. Design The following databases were reviewed: Medline, Web of Knowledge, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Sport Discus, SCOPUS, Oaister, DOAJ, Cochrane, EMBASE and Pedro. Material and methods A search for randomized clinical trials, cohort studies and case studies published 1996 to 2010 was made. The documents selected were classified according to the grades of recommendation of the DUODECIM Finnish society. Methodological quality of the 16 trials selected was assessed using the Delphi list. Results Two primary documents showed clinical changes on the quality of life of questionnaire aimed at respiratory patients. Those subjects who performed incremental exercise in the water showed functional changes in the distance walked in the walking test, in forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume. The incremental therapeutic water exercise recommended in the articles had an intensity ranging from 50% to 90% of VO2max with a frequency of two to five days a week. The sessions ranged from 30 to 50 minutes within a treatment period going from 8 to 24 weeks with water temperature varying from 29 °C to 38 °C. In future studies, subgroups of the patients can be made based on their initial physical condition in order to improve the outcomes of the intervention.			2011				2324
Current and Emerging Drug Treatment Options for Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review		Herrmann, N., Chau, S. A., Kircanski, I. and Lanctôt, K. L.				drugs	drugs	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and ultimately fatal condition that causes debilitating memory loss and extensive deterioration of cognitive and functional abilities. Currently available treatments for AD (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine) are symptomatic and do not decelerate or prevent the progression of the disease. These therapies demonstrate modest, but particularly consistent, benefit for cognition, global status and functional ability. The search for disease-modifying interventions has focused largely on compounds targeting the amyloid-? pathway. To date, the treatments targeting this pathway, such as tramiprosate and semagacestat, have been unsuccessful in demonstrating efficacy in clinical stages of testing. At this point, it is likely that not only amyloid-? aggregation but other possible neuronal mechanisms--such as hyperphosphorylated tau, neuro- inflammation and other processes - play important roles in the pathophysiology of this multifactorial disorder. Development of better disease models and biomarkers is essential for the advancement of knowledge of the disease mechanisms. This systematic review critically examines the efficacy and safety data for currently approved drugs and emerging treatments in AD, as well as discussing the present and future directions of innovation in this field.			2011				1308
A systematic review of the efficacy and safety outcomes of anti-VEGF agents used for treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration: comparison of ranibizumab and bevacizumab		Mitchell, P.				current medical research and opinion	current medical research and opinion	OBJECTIVE: To systematically review ocular and systemic events in treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, ranibizumab and bevacizumab, and to provide a detailed perspective of their differences on clinical use, efficacy and safety. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This review was based on a 2010 PubMed literature search performed using two separate terms: 'lucentis' OR 'ranibizumab' AND 'age-related macular degeneration' OR 'AMD' or 'avastin' OR 'bevacizumab' AND 'age-related macular degeneration' OR 'AMD'. A clinical diagnosis of wet AMD was defined by the authors of the trial reports. Clinical studies that met Level I or Level II evidence criteria were considered for review. FINDINGS: Eight large, randomized, controlled trials of ranibizumab (Level I) included 1,485 patients (range 162-716) and four open-label studies of ranibizumab (Level II) included 4,484 patients (range 32-4,300). Six studies (one Level I, five Level II) of bevacizumab included 424 patients (range 28-165). All demonstrated improvements in visual acuity. Only one study (Level II) compared the efficacy of ranibizumab and bevacizumab. Adverse ocular and systemic safety events occurring during the study were prospectively recorded for ranibizumab, irrespective of their suspected relationship to study treatments. Only three of six bevacizumab studies reported details of adverse ocular or systemic events. There was extensive Level I and Level II evidence to support both the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab in wet AMD. Data suggest that bevacizumab provides efficacy in wet AMD, but the safety profile of intravitreal bevacizumab remains to be established. CONCLUSION: In contrast to ranibizumab, current safety data for bevacizumab are incomplete and not yet robust. If the medical community remains committed to using intravitreal bevacizumab, it is critical to establish that it has an acceptable safety profile, supported by evidence-based medicine. Considerable further research is warranted to achieve this.			2011				2050
A systematic review of root canal filling materials for deciduous teeth: is there an alternative for zinc oxide-eugenol?		Barja-Fidalgo, F., Moutinho-Ribeiro, M., Oliveira, M. A. and de Oliveira, B. H.				isrn dentistry	isrn dentistry	The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether there is a root canal filling for deciduous teeth equally or more effective than zinc oxide-eugenol cement (ZOE). Six clinical trials selected for inclusion were independently reviewed by two researchers. Only two showed statistically significant different success rates between the test and the control groups. One found that an iodoform paste with calcium hydroxide (IP + Ca) performed better than ZOE, and the other found that ZOE performed similarly to IP + Ca. The other four studies compared ZOE with an iodoform paste (IP), a calcium hydroxide cement (Ca(OH)(2)), or IP + Ca. In these trials, the success rates in the ZOE groups were slightly lower than in the other groups. There seems to be no convincing evidence to support the superiority of any material over ZOE, and both ZOE and IP + Ca appear to be suitable as root canal fillings for deciduous teeth.			2011				1421
Efficacy and adverse effects of ketamine as an additive for paediatric caudal anaesthesia: a quantitative systematic review of randomized controlled trials		Schnabel, A., Poepping, D. M., Kranke, P., Zahn, P. K. and Pogatzki-Zahn, E. M.				british journal of anaesthesia	british journal of anaesthesia	BACKGROUND: The aim of this quantitative systematic review was to assess the efficacy and adverse effects of ketamine added to caudal local anaesthetics in comparison with local anaesthetics alone in children undergoing urological, lower abdominal, or lower limb surgery. METHODS: The systematic search, data extraction, critical appraisal, and pooled data analysis were performed according to the PRISMA statement. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this meta-analysis and relative risk (RR), mean difference (MD), and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the Revman(®) statistical software for dichotomous and continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs (published between 1991 and 2008) including 584 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was a significant longer time to first analgesic requirements in patients receiving ketamine in addition to a local anaesthetic compared with a local anaesthetic alone (MD: 5.60 h; 95% CI: 5.45-5.76; P<0.00001). There was a lower RR for the need of rescue analgesia in children receiving a caudal regional anaesthesia with ketamine in addition to local anaesthetics (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.44-1.15; P=0.16). CONCLUSIONS: Caudally administered ketamine, in addition to a local anaesthetic, provides prolonged postoperative analgesia with few adverse effects compared with local anaesthetics alone. There is a clear benefit of caudal ketamine, but the uncertainties about neurotoxicity relating to the dose of ketamine, single vs repeated doses and the child's age, still need to be clarified for use in clinical practice.			2011				1544
Robotic surgery in gynecology: an updated systematic review		Weinberg, L., Rao, S. and Escobar, P. F.				obstetrics and gynecology international	obstetrics and gynecology international	The introduction of da Vinci Robotic Surgery to the field of Gynecology has resulted in large changes in surgical management. The robotic platform allows less experienced laparoscopic surgeons to perform more complex procedures. In general gynecology and reproductive gynecology, the robot is being increasingly used for procedures such as hysterectomies, myomectomies, adnexal surgery, and tubal anastomosis. Among urogynecology the robot is being utilized for sacrocolopexies. In the field of gynecologic oncology, the robot is being increasingly used for hysterectomies and lymphadenectomies in oncologic diseases. Despite the rapid and widespread adoption of robotic surgery in gynecology, there are no randomized trials comparing its efficacy and safety to other traditional surgical approaches. Our aim is to update previously published reviews with a focus on only comparative observational studies. We determined that, with the right amount of training and skill, along with appropriate patient selection, robotic surgery can be highly advantageous. Patients will likely have less blood loss, less post-operative pain, faster recoveries, and fewer complications compared to open surgery and potentially even laparoscopy. However, until larger, well-designed observational studies or randomized control trials are completed which report long-term outcomes, we cannot definitively state the superiority of robotic surgery over other surgical methods.			2011				1611
The optimal surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism in MEN1 patients: a systematic review		Schreinemakers, J. M., Pieterman, C. R., Scholten, A., Vriens, M. R., Valk, G. D. and Rinkes, I. H.				world journal of surgery	world journal of surgery	BACKGROUND: The optimal surgical approach for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1) is controversial. We sought to determine the optimal type of surgery for pHPT in MEN1. METHODS: We collected data on clinical presentation, surgery, and follow-up for MEN1 patients with pHPT at the University Medical Center Utrecht and affiliated hospitals between 1967 and 2008. Furthermore, we performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis. Surgical procedures were classified into less than subtotal (<SPTX) versus subtotal (SPTX) and total parathyroidectomy (TPTX). RESULTS: Fifty-two patients underwent primary surgery for pHPT, of which 29 had <SPTX, 17 SPTX, and 6 TPTX. Recurrent pHPT was most frequent after SPTX (65%) followed by <SPTX (59%). Persistent disease was most frequent after <SPTX (31%). Time to recurrence was 61 months longer after SPTX than after <SPTX. Although recurrent pHPT was not seen after TPTX, permanent hypoparathyroidism developed in 67% of these patients. The meta-analysis showed that after SPTX and TPTX, patients had the lowest risk of persistent and recurrent pHPT. TPTX had the highest risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism. Large noncomparative studies showed a low recurrence rate after SPTX and TPTX. CONCLUSION: We believe that SPTX is the best surgical therapy for pHPT in MEN1. MEN1 patients with pHPT should not be treated with <SPTX because of the unacceptable high rate of recurrent and persistent pHPT. Additionally, a thymectomy should routinely be performed in these patients.			2011				1283
Outpatient management of cancer patients with febrile neutropenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Teuffel, O., Ethier, M. C., Alibhai, S. M., Beyene, J. and Sung, L.				annals of oncology : official journal of the european society for medical oncology / esmo	annals of oncology : official journal of the european society for medical oncology / esmo	BACKGROUND: In some centers, outpatient management for cancer patients with low-risk febrile neutropenia (FN) has been implemented into routine clinical practice. Our objective was to evaluate the current level of evidence before supporting widespread adoption of outpatient management for this population. METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials evaluating efficacy and safety of outpatient management of FN. RESULTS: From 1448 reviewed articles, 14 studies were included for meta-analysis. (i) Inpatient versus outpatient setting (6 studies) was not significantly associated with treatment failure [risk ratio 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-1.19; P = 0.28]. Death occurred in 13 of 742 FN episodes with no difference between the two groups (risk ratio 1.11; 95% CI 0.41-3.05; P = 0.83). (ii) Outpatient oral versus outpatient parenteral antibiotics (8 studies) were similarly efficacious with no association between route of drug administration and treatment failure (risk ratio 0.93; 95% CI 0.65-1.32; P = 0.67). No death occurred in 857 FN episodes. CONCLUSION: Based on the current literature, outpatient treatment of FN is a safe and efficacious alternative to inpatient management. Variation between studies in terms of time to discharge, choice of antibiotic class, and age of study population may limit the interpretation of the data.			2011				1743
A Systematic Review of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy for Older Adults with Mild to Moderate Dementia: An Occupational Therapy Perspective		Yuill, N. and Hollis, V.				occupational therapy international	occupational therapy international	In response to the need for effective non-pharmacological approaches for individuals with mild to moderate dementia, cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) interventions aim to optimize cognitive function. The present literature review explored the effectiveness of CST and the congruence of this approach with occupational therapy. Twenty-four databases and 13 'grey' sources were searched. Relevant papers were analysed using the McMaster Critical Literature Review Guidelines, the Modified Jadad Quality Scale and the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence Scale. To establish the congruence of CST with occupational therapy, themes were identified using the International Classification of Functioning and professional values outlined by the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists. Twelve studies demonstrated a trend towards delayed cognitive decline following CST. This intervention strategy is congruent with occupational therapy values and may provide a useful structural framework to build rehabilitation programmes for this population. Psychometric properties of the McMaster Guidelines have not yet been established, and there is no standardized way to extract quantitative data from this measure. There is a need for further research exploring outcomes of CST interventions within the context of everyday function in individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

Understanding what helps or hinders asthma action plan use: a systematic review and synthesis of the qualitative literature		Ring, N., Jepson, R., Hoskins, G., Wilson, C., Pinnock, H., Sheikh, A. and Wyke, S.				patient education and counseling	patient education and counseling	OBJECTIVE: To understand better what helps and/or hinders asthma action plan use from the professionals and patients/carers perspective. METHODS: Systematic review and qualitative synthesis (using meta-ethnography). RESULTS: Nineteen studies (20 papers) were included in an analysis of patients/carers' and professionals' views. Seven main influences on action plan implementation were identified including perceived un-helpfulness and irrelevance of the plans. Translation and synthesis of the original authors' interpretations suggested that action plan promotion and use was influenced by professional and patient/carers' asthma beliefs and attitudes and patient/carer experiences of managing asthma. Action plan use is hindered because professionals and patients/carers have different explanatory models of asthma, its management and their respective roles in the management process. Patients/carers, based on their experiential knowledge of their condition, perceive themselves as capable, effective in managing their asthma, but health professionals do not always share this view. CONCLUSION: Professionally provided medically focused action plans that do not 'fit' with and incorporate the patients'/carers' views of asthma, and their management strategies, will continue to be under-utilised. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Professionals need to develop a more patient-centred, partnership-based, approach to the joint development and review of action plans, recognising the experiential asthma knowledge of patients/carers.			2011				1444
Use of intrathecal baclofen therapy in ambulant children and adolescents with spasticity and dystonia of cerebral origin: a systematic review		Pin, T. W., McCartney, L., Lewis, J. and Waugh, M. C.				developmental medicine and child neurology	developmental medicine and child neurology	Aim Studies on the use of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) for ambulant adults with spasticity and/or dystonia of cerebral origin are scarce, and are even more limited for children and adolescents. This systematic review investigates the use of ITB to improve walking, transfer ability, and gross motor activities in ambulant children and adolescents with spasticity and/or dystonia of cerebral origin. Method Electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, full Cochrane Library, and PEDro) were searched from the earliest date available until March 2011 using combined subject headings and free text if supported by the databases. Studies were included if they had examined individuals who: (1) received ITB therapy by any method (bolus injection, an external delivery system, or an implanted pump); (2) had spasticity and/or dystonia of cerebral origin; (3) were able to ambulate with or without a walking device, i.e. individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) who were in levels I to III of the Gross Motor Function Classification System or individuals with similar functional mobility if they did not have CP; and (4) were aged 18 years or under. Publications in English in peer-reviewed journals reporting any type of research design, except reviews and expert opinions, were included. Studies were excluded if participants had spasticity and/or dystonia of spinal origin and if baclofen was administered only orally. Studies that compared ITB with other interventions such as botulinum toxin were also excluded. Results Two independent reviewers scored 16 studies against the guidelines for developing systematic reviews from the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine (AACPDM). Interpretation Fifteen studies were of levels IV or V evidence and only one of level II according to the evidence levels of the AACPDM guidelines, but all were of low quality. No study was found on the use of ITB in ambulant children or adolescents with dystonia of cerebral origin. Not all studies used objective outcome measures to assess the ambulation, transfer ability, and gross motor activities of the participants. A proportion of participants showed improvement in all these areas but adverse events were common. A proportion of participants compromised their ambulatory and transfer abilities after ITB. There was no evidence to support the clinical use of ITB in ambulant individuals with hypertonicity without further rigorous longitudinal studies.			2011				1501
Effectiveness of interventions for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon: a systematic review		Huisstede, B. M., Hoogvliet, P., Paulis, W. D., van Middelkoop, M., Hausman, M., Coert, J. H. and Koes, B. W.				archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation	archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation	OBJECTIVES: To present an evidence-based overview of the effectiveness of (non)surgical symptomatic interventions to treat secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, PEDro, and CINAHL were searched for relevant systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to select potential studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodologic quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: If pooling of data was not possible, a best-evidence synthesis was used to summarize the results. Of the 5 reviews and 19 RCTs included, 1 RCT studied acupuncture and another RCT reported on percutaneous radiofrequency thoracic sympathectomy. All others concentrated on the effectiveness of drugs (oral or intravenous [IV]). It appeared that calcium channel blockers significantly reduce the frequency and severity of Raynaud attacks, and are therefore effective in the treatment of secondary RP. Iloprost (oral and IV) was also found to be effective. Limited evidence was found for atorvastatin. For other traditional and more recently discovered interventions, no clear favorable effects were found. CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that there is clear evidence in favor of calcium channel blockers and iloprost (oral and IV) to treat secondary RP. For all other interventions, only limited, conflicting, or no evidence was found. More high-quality, well-designed RCTs are needed in this field, especially for new interventions based on recent knowledge about the pathophysiology of secondary RP.			2011				1012
Effect of Educational and Supportive Strategies on the Ability of Caregivers of People With Dementia to Maintain Participation in That Role		Thinnes, A. and Padilla, R.				the american journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the american occupational therapy association	the american journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the american occupational therapy association	A systematic review of evidence of the effectiveness of educational and supportive strategies for enabling caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or related dementias to maintain participation in that role was conducted as part of the American Occupational Therapy Association's Evidence-Based Literature Review Project. Forty-three articles met inclusion criteria. Results suggest that interventions that jointly engage people with AD and their caregivers in education and training in the home setting are more successful than strategies that focus solely on people with AD. Greater carryover is noted when education and training are implemented at the time that the caregiver identifies concerns. Interventions should provide caregivers with problem solving, technical skills, support, simple home modification strategies, and referral to community resources. Interventions mediated by technology have a positive effect on the caregiver and are especially important for those who live in rural areas.			2011				2111
Randomized clinical trials of self-management with Asian/Pacific Islanders		Inouye, J., Braginsky, N. and Kataoka-Yahiro, M.				clinical nursing research	clinical nursing research	Little has been reported in the literature about self-management strategies of chronic conditions in Asian and Pacific Islanders (APIs). The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of self-management strategies of chronic conditions in APIs. Twenty-one studies were included in the final review, published between 1997 and 2010. Initially, the Jadad Scoring of Quality of Reports of Randomized Clinical Trials (JSQRRC) was used to determine the quality of RCT studies. The researchers then did a systematic review of each of the RCTs based on the JSQRRC criteria. JSQRRC scores ranged from 8 to 12, M = 9.6. Descriptive analysis indicated cognitive behavioral interventions as an effective treatment methodology for APIs. The results underscore the importance of clarifying the methodological components and reporting of RCTs. Interventions appropriate for APIs using disaggregated ethnic groups are essential to determine specific cultural responses to treatments and outcomes.			2011				2068
Promoting cycling: a review of interventions		Vuori, I.				clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the canadian academy of sport medicine	clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the canadian academy of sport medicine	"OBJECTIVE: To determine which approaches promote cycling, the size of the effects, and whether there are associated benefits on physical activity or anthropometric measures, by means of a systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Intervention studies with a cycling outcome measure were identified from searches of 13 databases, previous systematic reviews, Web sites, and reference lists of selected articles. International experts were asked to identify further relevant published or unpublished studies. The search was completed in January 2010. STUDY SELECTION: The selection criteria were controlled trials and ""before and after"" studies of the effect of any intervention on cycling behavior; studies had to include a minimal or no intervention comparison group or a similar population; and a specific measure of cycling before and after the intervention was required. Studies using stationary bicycles were excluded. Of 32,916 records retrieved, 118 full-text articles were assessed, and 25 were included in the quantitative analysis. Each step in the selection process was independently reviewed by a second reviewer, and disagreements were resolved. DATA EXTRACTION: Details of the study setting, objective, intervention, sample, duration, outcome measures, and results were extracted and checked by 2 reviewers, who also assessed validity (evaluated in summary as yes/no on randomization, representativeness, comparability, measurement, and use of statistical test). Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Outcomes were summarized as absolute changes in cycling after adjustment for changes in the control group. Meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity and statistical inadequacies in the studies. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies [2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 cohort study, and 3 controlled repeat cross-sectional studies, all meeting ?3 validity criteria] included interventions primarily intended to promote cycling. An RCT using individual counseling and incentives as interventions found that Swedish women with abdominal obesity in the intervention group were more likely to report cycling >2 km per day after 18 months than the control group [odds ratio, 7.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0-15.0]. Increase in cycling was not associated with greater reductions in waist circumference in women in the intervention group than in the control group. A cluster RCT (Bike-Texas Safe Routes to School) using combined educational and promotional activities as interventions found no difference after 1 semester in cycling to school among fourth and fifth graders and their parents compared with control schools, but the prevalence of recreational cycling increased (net increase + 2.54 days per week; P = 0.02). In a controlled repeat cross-sectional study in the Netherlands, improving the connectivity of 1 area of Delft was associated with an increase from 40% to 43% in household cycle trips after 3 years, compared with a change from 38% to 39% in an unimproved area. In Odense, Denmark, promotion and improved infrastructure were associated, after 3 years, with a 3.4% net increase in bicycle trips (adjusted for regional trends). In a cohort study in Australia, residents in 1 area were encouraged by a wide-ranging promotional program, including cycle training and free bike hire, to use existing cycle paths. After 2 years, residents of the intervention area reported more use of the cycle paths than the comparison group (net change in prevalence, +5.1%; P < 0.01), and bicycle counters also showed greater cycle path use in the intervention area (net increase, 7.9%), but no increase in the prevalence of cycling in the population occurred. In English towns, media campaigns, services for cyclists, and improvements to infrastructure were associated with increased proportions of residents who reported cycling more frequently (net increase in proportions cycling ?12 times per month in 2 areas, 0.97% and 1.65%, and net increase in proportions cycling for ?30 minutes once per month, 2.78% and 1.89%) compared with control towns. There was a reduction in the proportion of residents in intervention areas who were classified as inactive (-2.6%; 95% CI, -3.7% to -1.5%), but no increase in the proportion who were more than moderately active. The effects of individualized marketing of walking, cycling, and public transit use as an alternative to car use were investigated in 16 studies (2 cohort studies and 14 controlled repeat cross-sectional studies; 13 studies met 2 validity criteria). Most studies included individualized information and incentives to households interested in changing their travel behavior and were associated with modest but generally consistent increases in self-reported cycling trip frequency (median, +8 trips per person per year; range, 0 to +21). CONCLUSIONS: Individual and community intervention programs, improving infrastructure, and marketing to households all increased cycling (usually self-reported) to a small extent. Environmental changes combined with advice and support may be needed to increase cycling substantially and in a sustainable way in the population."			2011				2616
Are natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery and single-incision surgery viable techniques for cholecystectomy?		Pollard, J. S., Fung, A. K. and Ahmed, I.				journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques. part a	journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques. part a	BACKGROUND: Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-incision surgery (SIS) are less invasive alternatives to traditional laparoscopic techniques. Concerns exist over the safety of these new approaches, and randomized controlled trials have yet to confirm a net benefit. If NOTES and SIS techniques are to become standard practice, then they should be shown to be safe and hold clear benefits to patients. We aim at comparing the available results by using these techniques in a standard laparoscopic operation (cholecystectomy). METHODS: A systematic review using available databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register) and the published English language medical literature was performed. All the archived articles were cross-referenced. Outcome data obtained from a Cochrane review of laparoscopic cholecystectomy were used as the control group. All the operations performed via a single incision were grouped under SIS, and operations in which a natural orifice (alone or as a hybrid technique) was analyzed, under NOTES group. Mortality and complications were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five papers including 4703 patients (714 NOTES, 3989 SIS) were selected for analysis. Overall complication rate was 4.2% in the NOTES group versus 4.3% in the SIS group, with a distinct complication profile. No mortality was reported in either group. NOTES procedures had a longer mean operative time than SIS techniques (107 versus 79 minutes). The conversion rate between NOTES and SILS was similar (3.4% versus 3.3%, respectively). DISCUSSION: No difference in the incidence of complications was observed with the newer techniques. Adequately powered randomized control trials are needed to clarify whether SIS/NOTES cholecystectomy has a similar length of hospital stay to traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The increased occurrence of specific types of complications and their use in acute pathology needs further investigation to warrant further use in routine surgical practice.			2012				2310
A systematic review of the combined use of electroconvulsive therapy and psychotherapy for depression		McClintock, S. M., Brandon, A. R., Husain, M. M. and Jarrett, R. B.				the journal of ect	the journal of ect	OBJECTIVE: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for severe major depressive disorder. However, after acute-phase treatment and initial remission, relapse rates are significant. Strategies to prolong remission include continuation phase ECT, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or their combinations. This systematic review synthesizes extant data regarding the combined use of psychotherapy with ECT for the treatment of patients with severe major depressive disorder and offers the hypothesis that augmenting ECT with depression-specific psychotherapy represents a promising strategy for future investigation. METHODS: The authors performed 2 independent searches in PsychInfo (1806-2009) and MEDLINE (1948-2009) using combinations of the following search terms: Electroconvulsive Therapy (including ECT, ECT therapy, electroshock therapy, EST, and shock therapy) and Psychotherapy (including cognitive behavioral, interpersonal, group, psychodynamic, psychoanalytic, individual, eclectic, and supportive). We included in this review a total of 6 articles (English language) that mentioned ECT and psychotherapy in the abstract and provided a case report, series, or clinical trial. We examined the articles for data related to ECT and psychotherapy treatment characteristics, cohort characteristics, and therapeutic outcome. RESULTS: Although research over the past 7 decades documenting the combined use of ECT and psychotherapy is limited, the available evidence suggests that testing this combination has promise and may confer additional, positive functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Significant methodological variability in ECT and psychotherapy procedures, heterogeneous patient cohorts, and inconsistent outcome measures prevent strong conclusions; however, existing research supports the need for future investigations of combined ECT and psychotherapy in well-designed, controlled clinical studies. Depression-specific psychotherapy approaches may need special adaptations in view of the cognitive effects of ECT.			2011				1241
Non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions for tremor: a systematic review		O'Connor, R. J. and Kini, M. U.				parkinsonism & related disorders	parkinsonism & related disorders	Tremor is a frequent disabling consequence of many neurological conditions. We performed a search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to identify all primary research studies published up to November 2010 which investigated non-pharmacological and non-surgical treatments for tremor in humans. Neuromuscular physiotherapy, strength training and functional electrical stimulation show promise in their applicability and adaptability. Limb cooling may not be feasible for continuous management, but may be appropriate for specific tasks. Tremor-suppressing orthoses based on viscous materials, weighted splints and vibration therapies need further evaluation especially in the domiciliary setting and applied to improving personal activities of daily living. The evidence base for many rehabilitation interventions in tremor is poor. Future research should focus on high quality randomized controlled trials of non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions which show promise.			2011				1641
A systematic review to evaluate the accuracy of electronic adverse drug event detection		Forster, A. J., Jennings, A., Chow, C., Leeder, C. and van Walraven, C.				journal of the american medical informatics association : jamia	journal of the american medical informatics association : jamia	Objective Adverse drug events (ADEs), defined as adverse patient outcomes caused by medications, are common and difficult to detect. Electronic detection of ADEs is a promising method to identify ADEs. We performed this systematic review to characterize established electronic detection systems and their accuracy. Methods We identified studies evaluating electronic ADE detection from the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. We included studies if they contained original data and involved detection of electronic triggers using information systems. We abstracted data regarding rule characteristics including type, accuracy, and rationale. Results Forty-eight studies met our inclusion criteria. Twenty-four (50%) studies reported rule accuracy but only 9 (18.8%) utilized a proper gold standard (chart review in all patients). Rule accuracy was variable and often poor (range of sensitivity: 40%-94%; specificity: 1.4%-89.8%; positive predictive value: 0.9%-64%). 5 (10.4%) studies derived or used detection rules that were defined by clinical need or the underlying ADE prevalence. Detection rules in 8 (16.7%) studies detected specific types of ADEs. Conclusion Several factors led to inaccurate ADE detection algorithms, including immature underlying information systems, non-standard event definitions, and variable methods for detection rule validation. Few ADE detection algorithms considered clinical priorities. To enhance the utility of electronic detection systems, there is a need to systematically address these factors.			2012				1208
Pharmacological treatment of COPD		Menezes, A. M., Macedo, S. E., Noal, R. B., Fiterman, J., Cukier, A., Chatkin, J. M., Fernandes, F. L., Grupo de Trabalho, Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisiologia and Grupo de Trabalho do Programa de Pós-Graduação em Epidemiologia, Universidade Federal de Pelotas				jornal brasileiro de pneumologia : publicaça?o oficial da sociedade brasileira de pneumologia e tisilogia	jornal brasileiro de pneumologia : publicaça?o oficial da sociedade brasileira de pneumologia e tisilogia	Approximately seven million Brazilians over 40 years of age have COPD. In recent years, major advances have been made in the pharmacological treatment of this condition. We performed a systematic review including original articles on pharmacological treatments for COPD. We reviewed articles written in English, Spanish, or Portuguese; published between 2005 and 2009; and indexed in national and international databases. Articles with a sample size < 100 individuals were excluded. The outcome measures were symptoms, pulmonary function, quality of life, exacerbations, mortality, and adverse drug effects. Articles were classified in accordance with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria for the determination of the level of scientific evidence (grade of recommendation A, B, or C). Of the 84 articles selected, 40 (47.6%), 18 (21.4%), and 26 (31.0%) were classified as grades A, B, and C, respectively. Of the 420 analyses made in these articles, 236 were regarding the comparison between medications and placebos. Among these 236 analyses, the most commonly studied medications (in 66, 48, and 42 analyses, respectively) were long-acting anticholinergics; the combination of long-acting ?(2) agonists and inhaled corticosteroids; and inhaled corticosteroids in isolation. Pulmonary function, adverse effects, and symptoms as outcomes generated 58, 54, and 35 analyses, respectively. The majority of the studies showed that the medications evaluated provided symptom relief; improved the quality of life and pulmonary function of patients; and prevented exacerbations. Few studies analyzed mortality as an outcome, and the role that pharmacological treatment plays in this outcome has yet to be fully defined. The medications studied are safe to use in the management of COPD and have few adverse effects.			2011				2491
Prophylactic feeding tubes for patients with locally advanced head-and-neck cancer undergoing combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy-systematic review and recommendations for clinical practice		Orphanidou, C., Biggs, K., Johnston, M. E., Wright, J. R., Bowman, A., Hotte, S. J., Esau, A., Myers, C., Blunt, V., Lafleur, M., Sheehan, B. and Griffin, M. A.				current oncology (toronto, ont.)	current oncology (toronto, ont.)	GOALS: This work aimed to determine the benefits and risks of prophylactic feeding tubes for adult patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who receive combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy with curative intent and to make recommendations on the use of prophylactic feeding tubes and the provision of adequate nutrition to this patient population. METHODS: A national multidisciplinary panel conducted a systematic review of the evidence and formulated recommendations to guide clinical decision-making. The draft evidence summary and recommendations were distributed to clinicians across Canada for their input. MAIN RESULTS: No randomized controlled trials have directly addressed this question. Evidence from studies in the target population was limited to seven descriptive studies: two with control groups (one prospective, one retrospective) and five without control groups. Results from ten controlled studies in patients treated with radiotherapy alone were also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence was insufficient to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of prophylactic feeding tubes in the target patient population or to support an evidence-based practice guideline. After review of the evidence, of guidelines from other groups, and of current clinical practice in Canada, the multidisciplinary panel made consensus-based recommendations regarding comprehensive interdisciplinary clinical care before, during, and after cancer treatment. The recommendations are based on the expert opinion of the panel members and on their understanding of best clinical practice.			2011				2242
Systematic review of the efficacy of parenting interventions for children with cerebral palsy		Whittingham, K., Wee, D. and Boyd, R.				child: care, health and development	child: care, health and development	This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of parenting interventions (i.e. behavioural family intervention and parent training) with parents of children with cerebral palsy (CP) on child behavioural outcomes and parenting style/skill outcomes. The following databases were searched: Medline (1950-April 2010), PubMed (1951-April 2010), PsycINFO (1840-April 2010), CINAHL (1982-April 2010) and Web of Science (1900-April 2010). No randomized clinical trials of parenting interventions with parents of children with CP were identified. Three studies were identified that involved the examination of a targeted parenting intervention via a pre-post design. Interventions utilized included the implementation of parenting interventions in conjunction with behavioural intervention and oral motor exercises for children with CP and feeding difficulties, the Hanen It Takes Two to Talk programme and a Functional Communication Training programme for parents. All studies found changes in relevant child behavioural outcomes. The studies reviewed suggest that parenting interventions may be an effective intervention for parents of children with CP. However, the current research is limited to pre-post designs of targeted parenting interventions (e.g. parenting interventions focused upon communication). A randomized controlled trial of parenting interventions for families of children with CP is urgently needed to address this paucity in the literature and provide families of children with CP with an evidence-based intervention to address child behavioural and emotional problems as well as parenting challenges.			2011				1299
Treatment of Proximal Hamstring Ruptures A Systematic Review		Harris, J. D., Griesser, M. J., Best, T. M. and Ellis, T. J.				international journal of sports medicine	international journal of sports medicine	Proximal hamstring ruptures are increasingly treated surgically, despite little high-level supporting evidence. We sought to determine whether there are differences in clinical outcome after surgical vs. non-surgical treatment of proximal hamstring tendinous avulsions/ruptures and acute vs. chronic surgical repair of tendinous avulsions. Multiple medical databases were searched for Level I-IV evidence. 18 studies were included. 298 subjects (300 proximal hamstring injuries) were analyzed with mean age of 39.7 years. 286 injuries were managed with surgical repair vs. 14 non-operative. 95 surgical cases were performed within 4 weeks of the injury (acute), while 191 were performed beyond 4 weeks (chronic). 292 injuries were tendinous avulsions while 8 were bony tuberosity avulsions. Surgical repair resulted in significantly (p<0.05) better subjective outcomes, greater rate of return to pre-injury level of sport, and greater strength/ endurance than non-surgical management. Similarly, acute surgical repair had significantly better patient satisfaction, subjective outcomes, pain relief, strength/endurance, and higher rate of return to pre-injury level of sport than chronic repair (p< 0.001) with reduced risk of complications and re-rupture (p<0.05). Chronic surgical repair also improves outcomes, strength and endurance, and return-to-sport, but not as well as acute repair. Non-operative treatment results in reduced patient satisfaction, with significantly lower rates of return to pre-injury level of sport and reduced hamstring muscle strength.			2011				1648
A systematic review of the literature on the chiropractic care of patients with autism spectrum disorder		Alcantara, J., Alcantara, J. D. and Alcantara, J.				explore (new york, n.y.)	explore (new york, n.y.)	BACKGROUND: In addition to impacting the affected child and his/her family's quality of life, recent estimates place the lifetime cost for an individual with ASD at $3.2 million and $35 billion for the entire birth cohort. Given the clinical heterogeneity of ASD, treatment approaches are multidisciplinary including alternative therapies, particularly when no pharmaceutical agent is effective for the core symptoms of ASD. Chiropractic is a popular alternative therapy for children. A systematic review of the literature was performed to provide context for future research endeavors in this field. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature on the chiropractic care of patients with ASD utilized 8 databases. Eligibility criteria for inclusion included: (1) the study was a primary investigation/report published in an English peer-reviewed journal; (2) the study involved patients ?18 years; and (3) patients are diagnosed with autism, Asperger's Syndrome, PDD-NOS, or ASD. RESULTS: Our systematic review of the literature revealed a total of five articles consisting of three case reports, one cohort study and one randomized comparison trial. The literature is lacking on documenting the chiropractic care of children with ASD. DISCUSSION: At the heart of the core symptoms of ASD (ie, impaired social interactions, deficits in communication and repetitive or restricted behavioral patterns) is abnormal sensory processing. Preliminary studies indicate that the chiropractic adjustment may attenuate sensorimotor integration based on somatosensory evoked potentials studies. CONCLUSION: We encourage further research for definitive studies on chiropractic's effectiveness for ASD. However, given the ineffectiveness of pharmaceutical agents, a trial of chiropractic care for sufferers of autism is prudent and warranted.			2011				1064
Implants in the pterygoid region: a systematic review of the literature		Bidra, A. S. and Huynh-Ba, G.				international journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery	international journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery	This systematic review aimed to identify clinical studies on the short-term and long-term survival of implants placed in the pterygoid region. A structured literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane databases. Relevant studies were selected according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data from the final included studies could only be extracted for calculating interval survival rate (ISR) and cumulative survival rate (CSR) of implants for different time intervals. The initial database search yielded 693 titles. After filtering, 32 abstracts were selected culminating in 17 full text articles. Three additional articles were added through a hand search to obtain a total of 20 articles. Application of exclusion criteria led to elimination of 11 articles. Pooled data from the final 9 articles showed a first year ISR of 92%. The CSR over a 10 year period, largely due to data from one study was 91%. The minimum follow-up period reported in various studies was less than a year. There is insufficient data about failures that occurred beyond the first year interval, making it difficult to draw conclusions about long-term survival of these implants. More studies with longer follow-up periods involving adequate number of pterygoid implants are needed.			2011				1282
Long-term survival after lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer with circulatory bypass: a systematic review		Muralidaran, A., Detterbeck, F. C., Boffa, D. J., Wang, Z. and Kim, A. W.				the journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery	the journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery	OBJECTIVE: Resection of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer using circulatory bypass is not frequently performed. The objective of this study was to systematically review the long-term survival associated with the published studies dealing with the performance of lung resections for non-small cell lung cancer using circulatory bypass. METHODS: A systematic review of publications dealing with lung resections for non-small cell lung cancer under circulatory bypass spanning from January 1, 1990, to December, 31 2010, was performed using a PubMed search with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary end point collected was survival. Several other clinical variables were also collected and analyzed. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate comparisons of survival were performed using a Cox proportional hazard model. Multivariate analysis was carried out using a Cox regression model. RESULTS: The search algorithm yielded 20 articles for the analysis. The overall 5-year survival was 37% (median, 36 ± 6 months). Survival was significantly higher when placement on bypass was planned (54%; median, 67 ± 19 months) as opposed to unplanned or emergency placement (11%; median, 19 ± 6 months; P = .006). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of unplanned bypass was prognostic for a worse long-term survival (hazard ratio = 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.90; P = .033). The 30-day and 90-day perioperative mortalities were 0% and 1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The literature over the past 2 decades demonstrates that favorable long-term survival for extended resections of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer using circulatory bypass can be achieved. The use of unplanned cardiopulmonary bypass, though, seems to be prognostic of unfavorable long-term survival.			2011				1236
Endoscopic endonasal compared with microscopic transsphenoidal and open transcranial resection of craniopharyngiomas		Komotar, R. J., Starke, R. M., Raper, D. M., Anand, V. K. and Schwartz, T. H.				world neurosurgery	world neurosurgery	OBJECTIVE: Craniopharyngiomas have traditionally represented a challenge for open transcranial or transsphenoidal microscopic neurosurgery because of their anatomical location and proximity to vital neurovascular structures. The extended endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach has been more recently developed as a potentially surgically aggressive, yet minimal access, alternative. To gain a more comprehensive assessment of the benefits and limitations of the various approaches to resection of craniopharyngiomas, we performed a systematic review of the available published reports after endoscope-assisted endonasal approaches and compared their results with transsphenoidal purely microscope-based or transcranial microscope-based techniques. METHODS: We performed a MEDLINE search of the modern literature (1995-2010) to identify open and endoscopic surgical series for pediatric and adult craniopharyngiomas. Comparisons were made for patient and tumor characteristics as well as extent of resection, morbidity, and visual outcome. Statistical analyses of categorical variables were undertaken by the use of ?(2) and Fisher exact tests with post-hoc Bonferroni analysis to compare endoscopic, microsurgical transsphenoidal, and transcranial approaches. RESULTS: Eighty eight studies, involving 3470 patients, were included. The endoscopic cohort had a significantly greater rate of gross total resection (66.9% vs. 48.3%; P < 0.003) and improved visual outcome (56.2% vs. 33.1%; P < 0.003) compared with the open cohort. The transsphenoidal cohort had similar outcomes to the endoscopic group. The rate of cerebrospinal fluid leakage was greater in the endoscopic (18.4%) and transsphenoidal (9.0%) than in the transcranial group (2.6%; P < 0.003), but the transcranial group had a greater rate of seizure (8.5%), which did not occur in the endonasal or transsphenoidal groups (P < 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic endonasal approach is a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of certain craniopharyngiomas. Larger lesions with more lateral extension may be more suitable for an open approach, and further follow-up is needed to assess the long-term efficacy of this minimal access approach.			2012				2483
Osteotome-Mediated Sinus Lift without Grafting Material: A Review of Literature and a Technique Proposal		Taschieri, S., Corbella, S., Saita, M., Tsesis, I. and Del Fabbro, M.				international journal of dentistry	international journal of dentistry	Implant rehabilitation of the edentulous posterior maxilla may be a challenging procedure in the presence of insufficient bone volume for implant placement. Maxillary sinus augmentation with or without using grafting materials aims to provide adequate bone volume. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the existing literature on transalveolar maxillary sinus augmentation without grafting materials and to propose and describe an osteotome-mediated approach in postextraction sites in combination with platelet derivative. The systematic review showed that high implant survival rate (more than 96% after 5 years) can be achieved even without grafting the site, with a low rate of complications. Available alveolar bone height before surgery was not correlated to survival rate. In the described case report, three implants were placed in posterior maxilla after extraction of two teeth. An osteotome-mediated sinus lifting technique was performed with the use of platelet derivative (PRGF); a synthetic bone substitute was used to fill the gaps between implant and socket walls. No complications occurred, and implants were successfully in site after 1 year from prosthetic loading. The presented technique might represent a viable alternative for the treatment of edentulous posterior maxilla with atrophy of the alveolar bone though it needs to be validated by studies with a large sample size.			2012				2221
Effect of the Platform-Switching Technique on Preservation of Peri-implant Marginal Bone: A Systematic Review		Al-Nsour, M. M., Chan, H. L. and Wang, H. L.				the international journal of oral & maxillofacial implants	the international journal of oral & maxillofacial implants	Purpose: The aim of this study was to systemically review the effect of platform switching on preserving implant marginal bone. Materials and Methods: An electronic search (PubMed and MEDLINE databases) and a hand search of peer-reviewed journals for English-language articles published before June 30th, 2010, were performed. The selected articles included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective comparative clinical trials with a minimal sample size of 10 subjects and 10 implants followed for at least 1 year after loading. The quality of included RCTs was also assessed. Results: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria; three were prospective comparative studies and six were RCTs. All studies applied either standardized conventional or digital periapical radiographs for the assessment of bone levels. Seven of the nine included articles demonstrated that platform switching was effective in preserving marginal bone around implants. The longest follow-up among these studies was 5 years. Conclusions: Based on the current evidence, the use of abutments with a smaller diameter than their corresponding implant platforms seems to exert beneficial effects on peri-implant marginal bone. Some potential confounding factors, for example, the apicocoronal position of implants in relation to crestal bone, the presence of various implant microtextures, the degree of platform switch, and the reliability of examination methods, should be considered when interpreting the present results.			2012				1864
A Systematic Review of Dialectical Behavior Therapy for the Treatment of Eating Disorders		Bankoff, S. M., Karpel, M. G., Forbes, H. E. and Pantalone, D. W.				eating disorders	eating disorders	Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has been proposed as an effective treatment for eating disorders (EDs). We conducted a systematic literature review to locate refereed journal articles testing DBT for the treatment of EDs. We identified 13 studies empirically evaluating treatment efficacy across various settings. Findings, based on mostly uncontrolled trials, indicate that DBT treatments appear effective in addressing ED behaviors and other forms of psychopathology in ED samples. The expectation that improvements in emotion regulation capabilities drive reductions in ED pathology was not fully supported. Further research is necessary to confirm the efficacy of modified DBT treatments for EDs.			2012				1067
Benefits and harms of CT screening for lung cancer: a systematic review		Bach, P. B., Mirkin, J. N., Oliver, T. K., Azzoli, C. G., Berry, D. A., Brawley, O. W., Byers, T., Colditz, G. A., Gould, M. K., Jett, J. R., Sabichi, A. L., Smith-Bindman, R., Wood, D. E., Qaseem, A. and Detterbeck, F. C.				jama : the journal of the american medical association	jama : the journal of the american medical association	CONTEXT: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, resulting in a very low 5-year survival. Screening may reduce the risk of death from lung cancer. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). A multisociety collaborative initiative (involving the American Cancer Society, American College of Chest Physicians, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network) was undertaken to create the foundation for development of an evidence-based clinical guideline. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid: January 1996 to April 2012), EMBASE (Ovid: January 1996 to April 2012), and the Cochrane Library (April 2012). STUDY SELECTION: Of 591 citations identified and reviewed, 8 randomized trials and 13 cohort studies of LDCT screening met criteria for inclusion. Primary outcomes were lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included nodule detection, invasive procedures, follow-up tests, and smoking cessation. DATA EXTRACTION: Critical appraisal using predefined criteria was conducted on individual studies and the overall body of evidence. Differences in data extracted by reviewers were adjudicated by consensus. RESULTS: Three randomized studies provided evidence on the effect of LDCT screening on lung cancer mortality, of which the National Lung Screening Trial was the most informative, demonstrating that among 53,454 participants enrolled, screening resulted in significantly fewer lung cancer deaths (356 vs 443 deaths; lung cancer?specific mortality, 274 vs 309 events per 100,000 person-years for LDCT and control groups, respectively; relative risk, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73-0.93; absolute risk reduction, 0.33%; P = .004). The other 2 smaller studies showed no such benefit. In terms of potential harms of LDCT screening, across all trials and cohorts, approximately 20% of individuals in each round of screening had positive results requiring some degree of follow-up, while approximately 1% had lung cancer. There was marked heterogeneity in this finding and in the frequency of follow-up investigations, biopsies, and percentage of surgical procedures performed in patients with benign lesions. Major complications in those with benign conditions were rare. CONCLUSION: Low-dose computed tomography screening may benefit individuals at an increased risk for lung cancer, but uncertainty exists about the potential harms of screening and the generalizability of results.			2012				1413
Impact of pharmacist interventions on patients' adherence to antidepressants and patient-reported outcomes: a systematic review		Al-Jumah, K. A. and Qureshi, N. A.				patient preference and adherence	patient preference and adherence	BACKGROUND: Pharmacist intervention in improving patient adherence to antidepressants is coupled with better outcomes. AIMS: The aim of this investigation was to systematically examine the published literature to explore different types of pharmacist interventions used for enhancing patient adherence to antidepressant medications. Three specific questions guided the review: what is the impact of pharmacist interventions on adherence to antidepressant medication? What is the impact of pharmacist interventions on patient-reported outcomes and patient satisfactions? What are the types of interventions used by pharmacists to enhance patients' adherence to antidepressants? SEARCH STRATEGIES: A systematic review of the literature was conducted during August-November 2010 using PubMed, BIOSIS Previews(®) Web of Science, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO(®), IngentaConnect, Cambridge Journals Online, and Medscape databases. Key text words and medical subject headings included pharmacist intervention, medication intervention, depression, medication adherence, health-related quality of life, patient-reported outcomes, and antidepressants. RESULTS: A total of 119 peer-reviewed papers were retrieved; 94 were excluded on the basis of abstract review and 13 after full-text analysis, resulting in twelve studies suitable for inclusion and intensive review. The most common intervention strategy that pharmacists utilized was a combination of patient education and drug monitoring. A cumulative patient adherence improvement in this review ranged from 15% to 27% attributed to utilization of different interventions and different combinations of interventions together with patient satisfaction with the treatment when depression improved. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that pharmacist intervention is effective in the improvement of patient adherence to antidepressants. This may be a basis for more studies examining the effectiveness of innovative interventions by pharmacists to enhance patient adherence to antidepressant medications.			2012				1104
Use of beta-blockers for the treatment of cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia: a systematic review		de Oliveira, F. C., Feitosa-Filho, G. S. and Ritt, L. E.				resuscitation	resuscitation	INTRODUCTION: Advanced Life Support guidelines recommend the use of epinephrine during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), as to increase coronary blood flow and perfusion pressure through its alpha-adrenergic peripheral vasoconstriction, allowing minimal rises in coronary perfusion pressure to make defibrillation possible. Contrasting to these alpha-adrenergic effects, epinephrine's beta-stimulation may have deleterious effects through an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption and a reduction of subendocardial perfusion, leading to postresuscitation cardiac dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: The present paper consists of a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of beta-blockade in cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). METHODS: Studies were identified through MEDLINE electronic databases research and were included those regarding the use of beta-blockade during CPR. RESULTS: Beta-blockade has been extensively studied in animal models of CPR. These studies not only suggest that beta-blockade could reduce myocardial oxygen requirements and the number of shocks necessary for defibrillation, but also improve postresuscitation myocardial function, diminish arrhythmia recurrences and prolong survival. A few case reports described successful beta-blockade use in patients, along with two prospective human studies, suggesting that it could be safe and effectively used during cardiac arrest in humans. CONCLUSION: Even though the existing literature points toward a beneficial effect of beta-blockade in patients presenting with cardiac arrest due to VF/pulseless VT, high quality human trials are still lacking to answer this question definitely.			2012				1493
Experiences integrating delivery of maternal and child health services with childhood immunization programs: systematic review update		Wallace, A. S., Ryman, T. K. and Dietz, V.				the journal of infectious diseases	the journal of infectious diseases	BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund promote integration of maternal and child health (MCH) and immunization services as a strategy to strengthen immunization programs. We updated our previous review of integrated programs and reviewed reports of integration of MCH services with immunization programs at the service delivery level. METHODS: Published and unpublished reports of interventions integrating MCH and immunization service delivery were reviewed by searching journal databases and Web sites and by contacting organizations. RESULTS: Among 27 integrated activities, interventions included hearing screening, human immunodeficiency virus services, vitamin A supplementation, deworming tablet administration, malaria treatment, bednet distribution, family planning, growth monitoring, and health education. When reported, linked intervention coverage increased, though not to the level of the corresponding immunization coverage in all cases. Logistical difficulties, time-intensive interventions ill suited for campaign delivery, concern for harming existing services, inadequate overlap of target age groups, and low immunization coverage were identified as challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this review reinforce our 2005 review findings, including importance of intervention compatibility and focus on immunization program strength. Ensuring proper planning and awareness of compatibility of service delivery requirements were found to be important. The review revealed gaps in information about costs, comparison to vertical delivery, and impact on all integrated interventions that future studies should aim to address.			2012				1726
Information interventions for recovery following vehicle-related trauma to persons of working age: a systematic review of the literature		Clay, F. J., Collie, A. and McClure, R. J.				journal of rehabilitation medicine	journal of rehabilitation medicine	"OBJECTIVES: Given the burden associated with vehicle-related trauma, there is interest in time and cost effective methods of providing information to assist recovery. This systematic review aims to address the question: ""Do targeted early information interventions improve outcomes following vehicle--related injuries for persons of working age?"" DATA SOURCES: Ovid Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO and Cochrane databases were searched for studies published between 1990-April 2011. DATA SELECTION: Included studies were randomized or pseudo--randomized controlled trials of information interventions delivered to working age persons following vehicle-related injuries. Two reviewers independently selected and appraised the studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixteen publications (13 primary studies) met the inclusion criteria and were assessed for bias. Hetero-geneity in terms of the information interventions and measured outcomes was encountered. In 4 of the included studies, the intervention was positively associated with at least one outcome reported. Methodological issues limited the conclusions that could be drawn. CONCLUSION: Following vehicle-related trauma, people often experience difficulties in ongoing functioning. The current evidence neither supports nor fails to support the effectiveness of information interventions in promoting injury recovery. There is a need for larger more methodologically and conceptually rigorous randomized controlled trials that better consider the type and timing of the intervention."			2012				1485
Antiviral therapy for HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis: case report and review of the literature		Fabrizi, F., Fogazzi, G. B., Cresseri, D., Passerini, P., Martin, P., Donato, M. F., Rumi, M. G. and Messa, P.				kidney & blood pressure research	kidney & blood pressure research	We describe the case of a 51-year-old woman with HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis (GN). She presented mild deterioration of kidney function, non-nephrotic proteinuria, and active urinary sediment. Kidney biopsy showed features of membranoproliferative changes with some sclerosis. Sustained viral response (SVR) was obtained by 6 months of antiviral therapy (peg-IFN-?2a plus ribavirin). SVR was linked with improvement of kidney function and remission of proteinuria. Clinical and virological remission persists over a 25-month follow-up. This case report emphasizes efficacy and safety of antiviral treatment of HCV-associated glomerulonephritis--preliminary but encouraging results exist. We identified by systematic review of the literature 9 studies (156 unique patients); the pooled estimate of frequency of sustained virological response after IFN-based therapy was 0.49 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.21, 0.77; p < 0.0005; random effects model). Heterogeneity was found (I(2) = 98.9%, p < 0.0001). Two possible regimens should be considered for the treatment of HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic GN according to the clinical presentation. Immunosuppressive therapy is recommended for HCV-related kidney disease having aggressive course, and recent evidence supports rituximab (RTX) use with a reduced exposure to corticosteroids. We identified six studies (66 unique patients) on RTX therapy for HCV-associated kidney disease; at the end of RTX therapy, the pooled estimate of the mean decrease in proteinuria was 1.4 g/24 h (95% CI: 0.75, 2.05, p < 0.001); The p test for heterogeneity gave a value of 0.94 (I(2) = 0). Several questions related to RTX use remain. HCV-induced GN is uncommon among CKD patients of developed countries, and this clearly hampers prospective controlled clinical trials aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of antiviral or immunosuppressive therapy in this population.			2012				2474
Oral corticosteroid therapy in chronic rhinosinusitis without polyposis: a systematic review		Lal, D. and Hwang, P. H.				international forum of allergy & rhinology	international forum of allergy & rhinology	BACKGROUND: Recognition of inflammation in the pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has caused corticosteroid therapy in CRS to gain favor. A systematic evaluation of oral steroid use in CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) has not been previously conducted. The objective of the study was to assess evidence on oral steroid therapy in CRSsNP, via a systematic literature review. METHODS: Ovid and PubMed databases were searched for studies on oral steroid therapy in CRSsNP. Manuscripts were reviewed and graded by evidence-based medicine (EBM) level. RESULTS: A total of 33 studies met inclusion criteria; 30 on CRSsNP and 3 on allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS). CRSsNP studies did not include any randomized controlled trial (RCT) or any clinical study employing systemic corticosteroids alone. They included 20 reviews/expert opinions (Level 5) with differing recommendations, and 4 treatment guidelines (Level 4) with weak recommendations on use. Three studies, 2 retrospective (Level 4) and 1 prospective study (Level 3), used oral steroids in combination with antibiotics and nasal steroids. The multidrug regimen improved symptoms, radiologic findings, short-term relapses, nasal endoscopy, and cytokine pattern expression. An experimental study (Level 5) found oral steroids to reverse sinonasal tissue inflammation. Two studies in animal models (Level 5) found no benefit of adding systemic steroids to antibiotics. Three clinical AFS studies, 1 RCT (Level 1) and 2 prospective (Level 3), found oral steroids to benefit postoperative recurrence, endoscopy or computed tomography (CT). CONCLUSION: No study has employed systemic corticosteroids alone in treating CRSsNP. Evidence supporting oral steroid therapy in CRSsNP is mostly Level 4 or 5; there is lack of any RCT to support use.			2012				1221
Sticker charts: a method for improving adherence to treatment of chronic diseases in children		Luersen, K., Davis, S. A., Kaplan, S. G., Abel, T. D., Winchester, W. W. and Feldman, S. R.				pediatric dermatology	pediatric dermatology	"Poor adherence is a common problem and may be an underlying cause of poor clinical outcomes. In pediatric populations, positive reinforcement techniques such as sticker charts may increase motivation to adhere to treatment regimens. To review the use of sticker charts to improve adherence in children with chronic disease, Medline and PsycINFO searches were conducted using the key words ""positive reinforcement OR behavior therapy"" and ""adherence OR patient compliance"" and ""child."" Randomized controlled retrospective cohort or single-subject-design studies were selected. Studies reporting adherence to the medical treatment of chronic disease in children using positive reinforcement techniques were included in the analysis. The systematic search was supplemented by identifying additional studies identified through the reference lists and authors of the initial articles found. Positive reinforcement techniques such as sticker charts increase adherence to medical treatment regimens. In several studies, this effect was maintained for months after the initial intervention. Better adherence correlated with better clinical outcomes in some, but not all, studies. Few studies examining the use of sticker charts were identified. Although single-subject-design studies are useful in establishing the effect of a behavioral intervention, larger randomized controlled trials would help determine the precise efficacy of sticker chart interventions. Adherence to medical treatments in children can be increased using sticker charts or other positive reinforcement techniques. This may be an effective means to encourage children with atopic dermatitis to apply their medications and improve clinical outcomes."			2012				2332
[Varying effect of telemedicine in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease--a systematic review]		Jakobsen, A. S., Laursen, L. C., Schou, L., Emme, C. and Phanareth, K. V.				ugeskrift for laeger	ugeskrift for laeger	A systematic review of existing evidence on the efficiency of telemedicine solutions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was performed. A systematic literature search was conducted in five relevant databases followed by evaluation of methodology and results in selected studies. Nine RCT trials of varying quality were identified. The selected studies were mostly multimodal with telemedicine as part of a more complex intervention. Benefits of using telemedicine solutions for patients with COPD are not yet clear, but in some multimodal studies with telemedicine as part of the solution a positive effect on hospital admissions, emergency room visits and contacts to primary care may be seen. Larger studies are needed.			2012				1037
The costs of centralisation: a systematic review of the economic impact of the centralisation of cancer services		Ke, K. M., Hollingworth, W. and Ness, A. R.				european journal of cancer care	european journal of cancer care	KE K.M., HOLLINGWORTH W. & NESS A.R. (2012) European Journal of Cancer Care 21, 158-168 The costs of centralisation: a systematic review of the economic impact of the centralisation of cancer services While evidence suggests that within specific cancer sites centralisation of services improves outcomes and quality of care, the economic impact of centralisation is unclear. This systematic review identified 19 studies that have investigated whether or not the centralisation of cancer services results in economies of scale, or is cost-effective, or increases the costs of accessing care for patients and their carers. Evidence from 13 studies suggests that increasing surgeon volumes are associated with cost reductions, although one study suggested that this relationship is U-shaped and the evidence is not consistent for hospital volumes and costs. Only one study demonstrated that centralisation was cost-effective with an incremental cost utility ratio of $5029 (3616) per quality-adjusted life year gained. Consistent evidence from four studies suggested that centralised services increase the costs of accessing care for patients and their carers. Current evidence on the economic impact of centralisation of cancer services is limited and of poor quality. Therefore, it remains unclear whether centralisation results in economies of scale and is cost-effective. Future research should be based on a clear definition of the different components of centralisation in order to determine which aspects of centralisation are efficient and for which cancer subgroups.			2012				1349
Consistency of fracture risk reduction in Japanese and Caucasian osteoporosis patients treated with teriparatide: a meta-analysis		Nakamura, T., Tsujimoto, M., Hamaya, E., Sowa, H. and Chen, P.				journal of bone and mineral metabolism	journal of bone and mineral metabolism	In the global Fracture Prevention Trial, teriparatide reduced the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures and significantly increased BMD. Recently, a 12-month, phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with BMD as a primary endpoint was conducted to assess the effects of teriparatide in Japanese subjects at high risk of fracture. Although BMD was significantly increased in the Japanese study, the study was not statistically powered to assess the anti-fracture efficacy with teriparatide treatment. A meta-analysis was carried out testing whether teriparatide had consistent anti-fracture efficacy in Japanese patients compared to that observed in the global fracture trial. Three studies in which fracture data were available from prospectively scheduled spinal radiographs were included in the analysis. A systematic review of the literature (Medline, Embase) confirmed that no studies with teriparatide had been excluded from this analysis. There was no significant heterogeneity for vertebral and non-vertebral fractures among the studies included in the meta-analysis. Odds ratio estimates (95% CI) were 0.29 (0.20, 0.43) for vertebral fracture and 0.53 (0.32, 0.86) for non-vertebral fracture. There was also a consistent effect of teriparatide to increase BMD across all studies. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrated that teriparatide-mediated increases in spine BMD accounted for 25-32% of the reduction in vertebral fracture risk in the combined population including Caucasian and Japanese patients, which was similar to that derived from Caucasian patients. These results provide evidence for the consistency of anti-fracture efficacy with teriparatide treatment in Japanese patients compared to those observed in Caucasian patients.			2012				2398
Comparative economic analyses of patient safety improvement strategies in acute care: a systematic review		Etchells, E., Koo, M., Daneman, N., McDonald, A., Baker, M., Matlow, A., Krahn, M. and Mittmann, N.				bmj quality & safety	bmj quality & safety	BACKGROUND: The objective was to systematically review comparative economic analyses of patient safety improvements in the acute care setting. METHODS: A systematic review of 15 patient safety target conditions and six improvement strategies was conducted. The authors searched the published literature through Medline (2000-November 2011) using the following search terms for costs: 'costs and cost analysis', 'cost-effectiveness', 'cost' and 'financial management, hospital'. The methodological quality of potentially relevant studies was appraised using Cochrane rules of evidence for clinical effectiveness in quality improvement, and standard economic methods. RESULTS: The authors screened 2151 abstracts, reviewed 212 potentially eligible studies, and identified five comparative economic analyses that reported a total of seven comparisons based on at least one clinical effectiveness study of adequate methodological quality. Pharmacist-led medication reconciliation to prevent potential adverse drug events dominated (lower costs, better safety) a strategy of no reconciliation. Chlorhexidine for vascular catheter site care to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections dominated a strategy of povidone-iodine for catheter site care. The Keystone ICU initiative to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections was economically dominant over usual care. Detecting surgical foreign bodies using standard counting compared with a strategy of no counting had an incremental cost of US$1500 (CAN$1676) for each surgical foreign body detected. Several safety improvement strategies were less economically attractive, such as bar-coded sponges for reducing retained surgical sponges compared with standard surgical counting, and giving erythropoietin to reduce transfusion requirements in critically ill patients to avoid one transfusion-related adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Five comparative economic analyses were found that reported a total of seven comparisons based on at least one effectiveness study of adequate methodological quality. On the basis of these limited studies, pharmacist-led medication reconciliation, the Keystone ICU intervention for central line-associated bloodstream infections, chlorhexidine for vascular catheter site care, and standard surgical sponge counts were economically attractive strategies for improving patient safety. More comparative economic analyses of such strategies are needed.			2012				1253
Chemotherapy before liver resection of colorectal metastases: friend or foe?		Lehmann, K., Rickenbacher, A., Weber, A., Pestalozzi, B. C. and Clavien, P. A.				annals of surgery	annals of surgery	OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review of the published literature to critically assess benefits and risks of the use of preoperative chemotherapy in patients presenting with colorectal liver metastases. BACKGROUND: In many centers, chemotherapy is used before hepatic resection of colorectal metastases, even in the presence of a single lesion. Application of chemotherapy requires clear conceptual distinction between patients presenting with resectable lesions (neoadjuvant) versus patients presenting with unresectable lesions, for which chemotherapy is used to reach a resectable situation (downsizing). METHODS: The literature (PubMed) was systematically reviewed for publications related to liver surgery and chemotherapy according to the methodology recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS: For unresectable liver metastases, combination regimens result in enhanced tumor response and resectability rates up to 30%, although the additional benefit from targeted agents such as bevacizumab or cetuximab is marginal. For resectable lesions, studies on neoadjuvant chemotherapy failed to convincingly demonstrate a survival benefit. Most reports described increased postoperative complications in a subset of patients due to parenchymal alterations such as chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. CONCLUSION: Preoperative standard chemotherapy can be recommended for downsizing unresectable liver metastases, but not for resectable lesions, for which adjuvant chemotherapy is preferred.			2012				2346
Improving quality of life of children with cerebral palsy: a systematic review of clinical trials		Tsoi, W. S., Zhang, L. A., Wang, W. Y., Tsang, K. L. and Lo, S. K.				child: care, health and development	child: care, health and development	Objective To systematically review the impact of different interventions on quality of life (QoL) for children with cerebral palsy. Methods English articles were sought from five major English databases from inceptions until March 2010. Keywords used consisted of four components (and their variants): (i) clinical condition: cerebral palsy; (ii) outcome measures: quality of life, well-being; (iii) study design: clinical trials; and (iv) target population: people aged 0-18. Results Eight studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, all of which are of good to excellent quality (a Jadad score of 4 or above). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, the TNO-AZL Children's Health-Related Quality of Life and the Caregiver Priorities and Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities were used to measure QoL. Significant positive results were reported by two studies using medicinal interventions (diazepam and intrathecal baclofen therapy, effect sizes 5.9, 9.1 respectively) and two studies employing motor control approach training (strength training and exercise training, former effect size being 3.8). Conclusion Current review suggests that positive effect was shown in medicinal and motor control interventions on QoL. However, no single interventional approach can demonstrate a consistent positive impact on QoL across different studies. Future studies are recommended to (i) provide a clear definition of QoL, and investigate the relationship between symptoms' severity and QoL; (ii) measure outcome at different time points to capture real effects of interventions; and (iii) make more use of valid outcome instruments, either self-report or parent/caregiver proxy reports.			2012				1804
Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colorectal cancer: a systematic review of 12 randomized controlled trials		Wu, X., Zhang, J., He, X., Wang, C., Lian, L., Liu, H., Wang, J. and Lan, P.				journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the society for surgery of the alimentary tract	journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the society for surgery of the alimentary tract	BACKGROUND: The impact of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy on the oncological outcomes for stage II colorectal cancer remains controversial. METHODS: The literature was searched for studies published between 1985 and 2010 in which patients with stage II colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to receive either surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or surgery alone. End points included 5-year overall survival, 5-year disease-free survival, recurrence, and mortality. RESULTS: A significant improvement in 5-year overall survival was associated with surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71-0.91) and for stage II rectal cancer (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61-0.86). The 5-year disease-free survival also favored the group of surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.98) and for stage II rectal cancer (hazard ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22-0.51). For stage II colon cancer, a significant reduction in risk of recurrence was found in favor of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (risk ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colorectal cancer appears to be associated with improved 5-year overall survival and 5-year disease-free survival, and reduction in risk of recurrence.			2012				1862
Timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Wang, X. and Jie Yuan, W.				renal failure	renal failure	"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to summarize the effects of timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) on mortality. METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other clinical studies was performed without language restriction in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. We estimated pooled relative risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using fixed effects model or random effects model as appropriate. Heterogeneity, publication bias, and subgroup analyses were conducted. RESULTS: We analyzed the date extracted from 15 studies (3 RCTs, 2 prospective, and 10 retrospective comparative cohort studies) with a total of 2955 patients. Overall, 51.0% (772/1514) patients died in the ""early"" RRT group compared with 58.0% (836/1441) in the ""late"" RRT group. The pooled RR was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.86), but the heterogeneity existed (p < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis based on modality did not record heterogeneity across trials. In continuous RRT (CRRT) group (n = 607), patients treated with ""early"" CRRT suggested a significant decrease in mortality compared with those in ""late"" CRRT group (27.8% vs. 43.0%) and the RR was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.84) without evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 33%, p = 0.18). In intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) group (n = 115), the RR was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.45) without evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, p = 0.50). In the mixed group, heterogeneity existed. CONCLUSION: ""Early"" CRRT and ""early"" IHD both could reduce the mortality of patients with acute kidney injury compared with ""late"" CRRT or IHD."			2012				1728
Acute distal tibiofibular syndesmosis injury: a systematic review of suture-button versus syndesmotic screw repair		Schepers, T.				international orthopaedics	international orthopaedics	PURPOSE: Recently, a new suture-button fixation device has emerged for the treatment of acute distal tibiofibular syndesmotic injuries and its use is rapidly increasing. The current systematic review was undertaken to compare the biomechanical properties, functional outcome, need for implant removal, and the complication rate of syndesmotic disruptions treated with a suture-button device with the current 'gold standard', i.e. the syndesmotic screw. METHOD: A literature search in the electronic databases of the Cochrane Library, EMbase, Pubmed Medline, and Google Scholar, between January 1st 2000 to December 1st 2011, was conducted to identify studies in which unstable ankle fractures with concomitant distal tibiofibular syndesmotic injury were treated with either a syndesmotic screw or a suture-button device. RESULTS: A total of six biomechanical studies, seven clinical full-text studies and four abstracts on the TightRope system, and 27 studies on syndesmotic screw or bolt fixation were identified. The AOFAS of 133 patients treated with TightRope was 89.1 points, with an average study follow-up of 19 months. The AOFAS score in studies with 253 patients treated with syndesmotic screws (metallic and absorbable) or bolts was 86.3 points, with an average study follow-up of 42 months. Two studies reported an earlier return to work in the TightRope group. Implant removal was reported in 22 (10%) of 220 patients treated with a TightRope (range, 0-25%), in the screw or bolt group the average was 51.9% of 866 patients (range, 5.8-100%). CONCLUSION: The TightRope system has a similar outcome compared with the syndesmotic screw or bolt fixation, but might lead to a quicker return to work. The rate of implant removal is lower than in the syndesmotic screw group. There is currently insufficient evidence on the long-term effects of the TightRope and more uniform outcome reporting is desirable. In addition, there is a need for studies on cost-effectiveness of the treatment of acute distal tibiofibular syndesmotic disruption treated with a suture-button device.			2012				1381
The effects of therapeutic exercise on the balance of women with knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review		Silva, A., Serrão, P. R., Driusso, P. and Mattiello, S. M.				revista brasileira de fisioterapia (são carlos (são paulo, brazil))	revista brasileira de fisioterapia (são carlos (são paulo, brazil))	"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to examine evidence regarding the effects of therapeutic exercise on the balance of women with knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: The search was conducted in Pubmed, Medline, Lilacs, SciELO, ISI web of knowledge, PEDro and the Cochrane Collaboration. We used the keywords: ""knee"", ""balance"", ""women"" and ""rehabilitation"" in combination with ""osteoarthritis"". We selected randomized controlled clinical trials published in English, Portuguese and Spanish over the last 10 years. To verify the methodological quality of selected clinical trials, the PEDro Scale was applied. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were found in the electronic search. Of these, only 9 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in full. Eight of these 9 studies were classified as having high methodological quality on the PEDro Scale. Although the methods and interventions regarding balance varied widely in these studies, most found significant improvement in the balance of women with knee OA. CONCLUSION: Since the studies included in this systematic review were of high methodological quality, we can conclude that the therapeutic exercises they used improved the balance of women with knee OA."			2012				1207
Report on a systematic review of the efficacy and clinical effectiveness of group analysis and analytic/dynamic group psychotherapy		Blackmore, Chris, Tantam, Digby, Parry, Glenys and Chambers, Eleni				group analysis	group analysis	This article reports on a systematic review to assess the efficacy and clinical effectiveness of group analysis and analytic/dynamic (A/D) group psychotherapy. Systematic literature searches were undertaken; 34 primary studies and 19 reviews met the inclusion criteria and their data was extracted. Of the primary studies, the randomized controlled trials provided evidence for the efficacy and clinical effectiveness of group therapy approaches in a range of clinical problems, but not for specific benefits of any particular theoretical approach. The controlled studies and observational studies gave support for the use of group psychotherapy in a variety of conditions. The review of reviews confirms that group therapies in general are more effective than wait list or standard care controls. Methodological challenges encountered and recommendations for further research are presented, along with a more detailed discussion of the implications of the review for the research community.

Influence of the dietary intake of medium chain triglycerides on body composition, energy expenditure and satiety: a systematic review		Rego Costa, A. C., Rosado, E. L. and Soares-Mota, M.				nutrición hospitalaria	nutrición hospitalaria	Increased prevalence of obesity is associated with the growth of chronic degenerative diseases. One of the main factors associated with this increase is the change in nutritional status of individuals. Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) are rapidly metabolized and less stored in the adipose tissue, being a possible tool for weight control. In order to analyze the influence of consumption of this lipid on satiety, body composition and energy expenditure (EE), a literature review was performed of controlled clinical studies reported in PUBMED and ELSEVIER between the years 2000 and 2010. Fourteen articles were selected presenting short and long-term intervention. Among these, six showed a decrease in body mass of individuals, with consequent loss of weight. Only one showed a positive effect on satiation and four showed an increase in EE. Thus the results are inconclusive and there is a need for further controlled studies with standardized amounts of MCT, so that its use can become an alternative for obesity nutritional treatment.			2012				2010
Physical therapies as an adjunct to Botulinum toxin-A injection of the upper or lower limb in adults following neurological impairment		Kinnear, B. Z.				systematic reviews	systematic reviews	BACKGROUND: Spasticity of muscles is a common consequence of central nervous system impairment. Traditionally, neurological rehabilitation for spasticity has involved occupational and physical therapy; however, increasingly Botulinum toxin-A injections may be provided. Injection effects are temporary. Consequently, understanding the effect of adjunct physical therapies will help inform multimodal rehabilitation decisions. Presently, these effects are not known. This systematic review will identify and summarize evidence on physical therapies used after Botulinum toxin-A injection to improve motor function in adults with neurological impairments. METHOD: Systematic searching of seven electronic databases will occur to identify relevant randomized trials. Available trial data will be extracted into a list of pre-defined primary outcomes, including range of movement, spasticity and functional limb use. Pre-defined secondary outcomes will also be reviewed where trials have these data available for reporting. Effects will be expressed as mean differences or standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, comparable results will be meta-analyzed, and a summary of the available pool of evidence produced.All randomized controlled trials will be rated using the PEDro methodological quality scale. Where possible, study data will be meta-analyzed using RevMan 5 Software. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO international prosepective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2011:CRD42011001491). DISCUSSION: Review results will be the most comprehensive answer available to the following question: Are physical therapies clinically effective after Botulinum toxin-A injections in adults with neurological spasticity? Results will inform healthcare providers and managers who determine who gets access to and provision of Botulinum toxin-A injection and whether this is done with or without physical therapies. Results will inform the clinicians who conduct physical therapy following injection. This protocol provides readers with the scope and depth of a search that will ultimately answer a complex and pressing treatment question. The variability of current practice and high level of expense associated with multimodal rehabilitation means review results will be more useful and less contestable if the protocol is revealed in full through advance publication.			2012				2098
Probiotics for the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Hempel, S., Newberry, S. J., Maher, A. R., Wang, Z., Miles, J. N., Shanman, R., Johnsen, B. and Shekelle, P. G.				jama : the journal of the american medical association	jama : the journal of the american medical association	CONTEXT: Probiotics are live microorganisms intended to confer a health benefit when consumed. One condition for which probiotics have been advocated is the diarrhea that is a common adverse effect of antibiotic use. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence for probiotic use in the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). DATA SOURCES: Twelve electronic databases were searched (DARE, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, MANTIS, TOXLINE, ToxFILE, NTIS, and AGRICOLA) and references of included studies and reviews were screened from database inception to February 2012, without language restriction. STUDY SELECTION: Two independent reviewers identified parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and/or Bacillus) for the prevention or treatment of AAD. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed trial quality. RESULTS: A total of 82 RCTs met inclusion criteria. The majority used Lactobacillus-based interventions alone or in combination with other genera; strains were poorly documented. The pooled relative risk in a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis of 63 RCTs, which included 11 811 participants, indicated a statistically significant association of probiotic administration with reduction in AAD (relative risk, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.68; P < .001; I(2), 54%; [risk difference, -0.07; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.05], [number needed to treat, 13; 95% CI, 10.3 to 19.1]) in trials reporting on the number of patients with AAD. This result was relatively insensitive to numerous subgroup analyses. However, there exists significant heterogeneity in pooled results and the evidence is insufficient to determine whether this association varies systematically by population, antibiotic characteristic, or probiotic preparation. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with a reduction in AAD. More research is needed to determine which probiotics are associated with the greatest efficacy and for which patients receiving which specific antibiotics.			2012				1826
The effect of combination treatment with aliskiren and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system on hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury: systematic review and meta-analysis		Harel, Z., Gilbert, C., Wald, R., Bell, C., Perl, J., Juurlink, D., Beyene, J. and Shah, P. S.				bmj (clinical research ed.)	bmj (clinical research ed.)	OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety of using aliskiren combined with agents used to block the renin-angiotensin system. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and two trial registries, published up to 7 May 2011. STUDY SELECTION: Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials that compared combined treatment using aliskiren and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with monotherapy using these agents for at least four weeks and that provided numerical data on the adverse event outcomes of hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for these outcomes. RESULTS: 10 randomised controlled studies (4814 participants) were included in the analysis. Combination therapy with aliskiren and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers significantly increased the risk of hyperkalaemia compared with monotherapy using angiotensin converting enzymes or angiotensin receptor blockers (relative risk 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 2.02) or aliskiren alone (1.67, 1.01 to 2.79). The risk of acute kidney injury did not differ significantly between the combined therapy and monotherapy groups (1.14, 0.68 to 1.89). CONCLUSION: Use of aliskerin in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers is associated with an increased risk for hyperkalaemia. The combined use of these agents warrants careful monitoring of serum potassium levels.			2012				1570
Excessive weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy: a systematic review		Fischer, L., Hildebrandt, C., Bruckner, T., Kenngott, H., Linke, G. R., Gehrig, T., Büchler, M. W. and Müller-Stich, B. P.				obesity surgery	obesity surgery	BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) as a primary bariatric intervention is still under debate. This article aims to systematically analyze excessive weight loss (EWL) in patients after SG. METHODS: A systematic literature search on SG from the period January 2003 to December 2010 was performed. Data described from systematic reviews dealing with gastric bypass procedures was used as comparator. RESULTS: The final study included 123 papers describing 12,129 patients. Most of the papers describe EWL at 12 months (43.9% of all papers). For SG, the maximum EWL occurred 24 and 36 months postoperatively with a mean EWL of 64.3% (minimum 46.1%, maximum 75.0%) and 66.0% (minimum 60.0%, maximum 77.5%), respectively. At 12 months, the mean EWL in patients receiving SG was significantly lower when compared to patients who underwent gastric bypass (SG 56.1%, gastric bypass 68.3%; p < 0.01, two-sided Wilcoxon test). Although patients with gastric bypass still had higher EWL rates at 24 months compared to patients after SG, these differences were not significant (SG 61.3%, gastric bypass 69.6%; p = 0.09, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Reoperations after SG are necessary in 6.8% (range 0.7-25%) of cases with patients receiving SG as a stand alone procedure and in 9.6-28.5% of cases with patients undergoing SG as a planned first stage procedure. CONCLUSIONS: SG is an effective bariatric procedure with a lasting effect on EWL. Compared with gastric bypasses, there is no difference in EWL at the time point of 24 months.			2012				1622
Systematic review: antibodies and anti-TNF-? levels in inflammatory bowel disease		Chaparro, M., Guerra, I., Muñoz-Linares, P. and Gisbert, J. P.				alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	BACKGROUND: The associations between clinical efficacy and infusion reactions with anti-TNF-? drug levels and the presence of antibodies against the drug have been described. However, the clinical utility of these tests in routine clinical practice remains unclear. AIMS: To examine the clinical significance of the development of antibodies against anti-TNF-? drugs and the relationship between the efficacy of these drugs and their serum levels. We also studied the clinical utility of testing for anti-TNF-? antibodies and measuring drug serum levels to optimise treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving these agents. METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken based on electronic searches of the PubMed database from the earliest record to February 2012. The reference lists of all relevant articles and abstracts from meetings were also consulted. RESULTS: We observed a close relationship between trough levels of anti-TNF-? drug and maintenance of response to these drugs. The role of antibodies in loss of response seems to be limited to their effect favouring the clearance of the drug. The risk of infusion reactions, but not of delayed hypersensitivity reactions, is higher in patients with antibodies against the anti-TNF-? drug. Testing anti-TNF-? drug and antibody levels, together with clinical and endoscopic or radiological assessment, seems useful when attempting to optimise therapy and prevent inappropriate management of IBD patients. CONCLUSION: Measurement of serum anti-TNF-? trough levels and antibody titres could prove useful in therapeutic drug monitoring in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-? agents.			2012				1004
Oral health promotion interventions on oral reservoirs of staphylococcus aureus: a systematic review		Lam, O. L., McGrath, C., Bandara, H. M., Li, L. S. and Samaranayake, L. P.				oral diseases	oral diseases	Oral Diseases (2012) 18, 244-254 The oral cavity serves as a reservoir of Staphylococcus aureus for infection of the lower respiratory tract and cross-infection to other patients. This systematic review was designed to examine the effectiveness of oral health promotion interventions on this pathogen. The PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for clinical trials assessing the effect of oral health promotion interventions on oral and oropharyngeal carriage of S. aureus. Oral health promotion interventions on oral reservoirs of S. aureus in both systemically healthy and medically compromised groups consisted of oral hygiene interventions only. There was a lack of evidence pertaining to the effectiveness of mechanical oral hygiene interventions against this pathogen. Chlorhexidine delivered in oral hygiene products such as mouthrinses, gels, and sprays appeared to have some utility against S. aureus, although some studies found equivocal effects. There was a dearth of studies investigating the efficacy of other chemical agents. Although many chemical agents contained in oral hygiene products have proven in vitro activity against S. aureus, their clinical effectiveness and potential role as adjuncts or alternative therapies to conventional treatment remain to be confirmed by further high-quality randomized controlled trials.			2012				1325
Tumor lysis syndrome: a systematic review of case series and case reports		Firwana, B. M., Hasan, R., Hasan, N., Alahdab, F., Alnahhas, I., Hasan, S. and Varon, J.				postgraduate medicine	postgraduate medicine	Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a clinical condition that is caused by a massive lysis of tumor cells that accumulate very rapidly and disturb hemodynamics. This oncologic emergency requires immediate intervention. Tumor lysis syndrome was first described in the 19th century. Since then, it has become a well-known disease with improved management measures. Tumor lysis syndrome can occur after any type of neoplasm. It is highly associated with rapidly proliferating tumors compared with those that are well demarcated, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Initiation of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or steroid treatment may trigger TLS, or it may develop spontaneously. The release of massive quantities of intracellular contents may produce hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, secondary hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and acute renal failure. Prevention and treatment measures include intravenous hydration, use of allopurinol and rasburicase, management of TLS-associated electrolyte abnormalities, and renal replacement therapy; the use of urine alkalinization remains controversial. In this article, we summarize the findings of case series and case reports published over the past 6 years in an effort to help familiarize clinicians better recognize and manage TLS.			2012				1893
A systematic review of symptomatic duodenal perforation by inferior vena cava filters		Malgor, R. D. and Labropoulos, N.				journal of vascular surgery	journal of vascular surgery	OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of the literature on symptomatic duodenal perforation caused by inferior vena cava (IVC) filters. METHODS: Three databases, PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Sciences, and Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), reference lists of review articles and conference proceedings were searched. All articles containing data on clinical presentation, diagnostic strategy, and available treatment of symptomatic duodenal perforation caused by an IVC filter were included regardless of design, language, size, or length of follow-up. RESULTS: Seventy-two articles were selected for full-text screening, being 21 case reports were selected. The median age was 46 years old (range, 21-83 years old). Abdominal pain was reported in 11 patients and gastrointestinal bleed in 5 patients. The indications for IVC filter placement in this cohort of patients were contraindication of anticoagulation and recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) despite therapeutic levels in 8 and 5 patients, respectively. Three different imaging modalities were obtained in 9 patients (43%) before confirming the diagnosis. All but 1 patient underwent open approach through laparotomy with or without removal of the filter. No PEs or deaths were reported and only 1 patient had a severe clinical complication of IVC and bilateral iliac vein thrombosis with massive lower extremities edema. CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal perforation caused by IVC filters is a rare complication that frequently requires extensive workup. Excellent outcomes with low complication rate have been reported in cases where an open procedure was performed with either extraction of the filter or removal of the offending struts.			2012				1190
Evidence for the effectiveness of Alexander Technique lessons in medical and health-related conditions: a systematic review		Woodman, J. P. and Moore, N. R.				international journal of clinical practice	international journal of clinical practice	Background: Complementary medicine and alternative approaches to chronic and intractable health conditions are increasingly being used, and require critical evaluation. Objective: The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate available evidence for the effectiveness and safety of instruction in the Alexander Technique in health-related conditions. Methods: PUBMED, EMBASE, PSYCHINFO, ISI Web-of-Knowledge, AMED, CINHAL-plus, Cochrane library and Evidence-based Medicine Reviews were searched to July 2011. Inclusion criteria were prospective studies evaluating Alexander Technique instruction (individual lessons or group delivery) as an intervention for any medical indication/health-related condition. Studies were categorised and data extracted on study population, randomisation method, nature of intervention and control, practitioner characteristics, validity and reliability of outcome measures, completeness of follow-up and statistical analyses. Results: Of 271 publications identified, 18 were selected: three randomised, controlled trials (RCTs), two controlled non-randomised studies, eight non-controlled studies, four qualitative analyses and one health economic analysis. One well-designed, well-conducted RCT demonstrated that, compared with usual GP care, Alexander Technique lessons led to significant long-term reductions in back pain and incapacity caused by chronic back pain. The results were broadly supported by a smaller, earlier RCT in chronic back pain. The third RCT, a small, well-designed, well-conducted study in individuals with Parkinson's disease, showed a sustained increased ability to carry out everyday activities following Alexander lessons, compared with usual care. The 15 non-RCT studies are also reviewed. Conclusions: Strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of Alexander Technique lessons for chronic back pain and moderate evidence in Parkinson's-associated disability. Preliminary evidence suggests that Alexander Technique lessons may lead to improvements in balance skills in the elderly, in general chronic pain, posture, respiratory function and stuttering, but there is insufficient evidence to support recommendations in these areas.			2012				1888
New Oral Anticoagulants for Atrial Fibrillation: A Review of Clinical Trials		O'Dell, K. M., Igawa, D. and Hsin, J.				clinical therapeutics	clinical therapeutics	Abstract: Background: Warfarin had been the only oral anticoagulant for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) for decades. Direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors are new anticoagulants recently approved for prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with AF. Objective: The aim of this article was to provide a systematic review of recently published clinical data on the direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors in the management of AF. Methods: A search of the ClinicalTrials.gov registry was conducted using the subject terms dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. Each search was limited to clinical trials that included patients with AF. Completed studies with warfarin as the main comparator were identified. From the yielded results, the national clinical trial identifier was inputted in PubMed (1966November 2011) for a search of published literature. Results: Three Phase III clinical trials reported the efficacy of each agent in patients who have AF and risk factors for stroke or embolic complications. The Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) study reported dabigatran 150 mg was associated with a lower rate of stroke and systemic embolism, whereas dabigatran 110 mg was associated with a similar rate for such events when compared with warfarin (relative risk = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.530.82; P < 0.001; and relative risk = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.741.11; P = 0.34, respectively). From the intention-to-treat analysis of the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF) study, rivaroxaban was reported to be noninferior to warfarin in reducing stroke or systemic embolism (2.1% vs 2.4% per year; hazard ratio = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.751.03; P < 0.001). The Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thrombotic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial reported that apixaban reduced stroke or systemic embolic events by 21% when compared with warfarin (1.27% vs 1.60% per year, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.660.95; P < 0.001). All 3 agents were associated with similar bleeding when compared with warfarin. Conclusions: Published data suggest that all 3 agents are at least as efficacious as dose-adjusted warfarin, with similar major bleeding profiles. For patients who are unwilling to adhere to regular coagulation monitoring or whose therapeutic effect using warfarin is not optimal despite adequate monitoring and management, the inhibitors of direct thrombin or factor Xa may provide alternative choices in anticoagulation.			2012				2567
Systematic review of services providing information and/or advice to people with dementia and/or their caregivers		Corbett, A., Stevens, J., Aarsland, D., Day, S., Moniz-Cook, E., Woods, R., Brooker, D. and Ballard, C.				international journal of geriatric psychiatry	international journal of geriatric psychiatry	BACKGROUND: Information is a key part of service provision to people with dementia and their carers, but there is no systematic review of the evidence. This study aimed to determine whether information services confer significant benefit for quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms and carer burden. METHOD: A systematic review of intervention studies in people with dementia was carried out, focussing predominantly on the provision of information and/or advice. RESULTS: Thirteen randomised controlled trials were identified. Two of the three studies measuring quality of life indicated benefit. Significant benefits were also evident for neuropsychiatric symptoms (points difference, -1.48; confidence interval, -2.11 to 0.86), but not carer burden. Most interventions included other key elements such as skills training, telephone support and direct help to navigate the medical and care system. CONCLUSION: There is some support for the value of information services, but studies are needed to determine the specific elements that are effective.

Effect of the introducer technique compared with the pull technique on the peristomal infection rate in PEG: a meta-analysis		Campoli, P. M., de Paula, A. A., Alves, L. G. and Turchi, M. D.				gastrointestinal endoscopy	gastrointestinal endoscopy	Background: Peristomal infection is a main complication of PEG. The pull technique appears to be associated with higher infection rates compared with the introducer technique, although published results are controversial. Objective: To determine which technique is associated with a higher risk of infection. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting: Studies reporting rates of peristomal infection after PEG performed by either the pull or introducer technique. Patients: This study involved 2336 patients from 6 comparative and 10 observational studies. Intervention: Public MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine journal articles database), Excerpta Medica Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information databases and proceedings of two meetings, Digestive Disease Week and United European Gastroenterology Week, were searched. Both comparative and observational studies were included and analyzed separately. Main Outcome Measurements: Effect measures from each comparative study were reported as the odds ratio (OR). The pooled effect was then calculated. The infection rate in each observational study was also calculated, and a summary effect was then determined. Results: In comparative studies, the risk of infection was significantly higher with the pull technique (OR 13.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6-36.8; P < .0001). Similarly, observational studies also reported higher infection rates with the pull technique (10.7%; 95% CI, 4.9-21.8 with the pull technique vs 0.9%; 95% CI, 0.2-4.5 with the introducer technique). Limitations: Few studies were available for inclusion, and there was a high risk of bias among the comparative studies. Conclusion: The pull technique appears to be associated with a significantly higher risk of infection compared with the introducer technique.			2012				2510
Are birth kits a good idea? A systematic review of the evidence		Hundley, V. A., Avan, B. I., Braunholtz, D. and Graham, W. J.				midwifery	midwifery	OBJECTIVE: to identify the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of births kits on clean birth practices and on newborn and maternal outcomes. DESIGN: the scoping review was informed through a systematic literature review; a call for information distributed to experts in maternal and child health, relevant research centres and specialist libraries; and a search of the web sites of groups working in the area of maternal and child health. Data were synthesised to produce a summary of the state of knowledge regarding birth kits. Meta-analysis was not attempted because of the varied study designs and the heterogeneous nature of the interventions. PARTICIPANTS: births kit use was identified in 51 low resource countries, but evaluations were scarce, with only nine studies reporting effects of intervention packages including births kits. FINDINGS: the quality of evidence for inferring causality was weak, with only one randomised controlled trial. In two studies, births kit use along with co-interventions resulted in a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of the attendant having clean hands. The impact on other aspects of cleanliness was less clear. Intervention packages which include births kits were associated with reduced newborn mortality (three studies), omphalitis (four studies), and puerperal sepsis (three studies). The one study that considered maternal mortality was not large enough to estimate relative reduction with much precision. None of the studies reported any adverse effects; however, none explicitly described looking for negative consequences. CONCLUSION: providing birth kits to facilitate clean practices seems commonsense, but there is no evidence to indicate effects, positive or negative, separate from those achieved by a broader intervention package. More robust methods and knowledge systems are needed to understand the contextual factors and share relevant implementation lessons.			2012				1254
Influence of Beverage Temperature on Palatability and Fluid Ingestion During Endurance Exercise: A Systematic Review		Burdon, C. A., Johnson, N. A., Chapman, P. G. and O'Connor, H. T.				international journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism	international journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism	Beverage palatability is known to influence fluid consumption during exercise and may positively influence hydration status and help prevent fatigue, heat illness, and decreased performance. Purpose: The aims of this review were to evaluate the effect of beverage temperature on fluid intake during exercise and investigate the influence of beverage temperature on palatability. Methods: Citations from multiple databases were searched from the earliest record to November 2010 using the terms beverage, fluid, or water and palatability, preference, feeding, and drinking behavior and temperature. Included studies (N = 14) needed to use adult (?18 yr) human participants, have beverage temperatures ?50 Â°C, and measure consumption during exercise and/or palatability. Results: All studies reporting palatability (n = 10) indicated that cold (0-10 Â°C) or cool (10-22 Â°C) beverages were preferred to warmer ones (control, ?22 Â°C). A meta-analysis on studies reporting fluid consumption (n = 5) revealed that participants consumed ~50% (effect size = 1.4, 0.75.2.04, 95% CI) more cold/cool beverages than control during exercise. Subanalysis of studies assessing hydration status (n = 4) with consumption of cool/cold vs. warm beverages demonstrated that dehydration during exercise was reduced by 1.3% of body weight (1.6-0.9%, 95% CI; p < .001). Conclusion: Cool beverage temperatures (<22 Â°C) significantly increased fluid palatability, fluid consumption, and hydration during exercise vs. control (?22 Â°C).			2012				1883
Collagen meniscus implantation: a systematic review including rehabilitation and return to sports activity		Harston, A., Nyland, J., Brand, E., McGinnis, M. and Caborn, D. N.				knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the esska	knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the esska	PURPOSE: To determine collagen meniscus implant (CMI) efficacy for improving patient function, symptoms, and activity level. Study methodologies, rehabilitation, and return to sports guidelines were also reviewed. METHODS: MedLine, EMBASE, CINAHL, Life Science Citations, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from January 1995-May 2011 using the term collagen meniscal or meniscus implant. Only human studies with English language abstracts that reported patient outcomes were included. Modified Coleman Methodology criteria were used to score research quality. RESULTS: Eleven studies with 520 subjects (men = 428; women = 92; 17.7% women) of 38.2 ± 3.7 years of age met the inclusion criteria. Of these subjects, 321 (men = 263, women = 58; 18.1% women) received a CMI. Based primarily on Lysholm Knee Score, Tegner Activity Scale, pain scales and self-assessment measurements knee function, symptoms, and activity level generally improved by 46.6 ± 39.9 months post-surgery. Rehabilitation was described in 9/11 (81.8%) studies and four released patients to full activities at 6 months post-surgery. No study described how advanced rehabilitation or function testing contributed to return to activity decision-making. Research quality was generally low (67.1 ± 18.6) with widely ranging (29-97) scores. Reduced CMI size at last follow-up was reported in 6/11 (54.5%) studies, but the significance of this finding is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Knee function, symptoms, and activity level generally improved following CMI use, but poor research report quality was common. Additional well-designed long-term prospective studies are needed to better determine knee osteoarthrosis prevention efficacy and appropriate patient selection.			2012				1873
Adjuvant therapy in the treatment of biliary tract cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Horgan, A. M., Amir, E., Walter, T. and Knox, J. J.				journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the american society of clinical oncology	journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the american society of clinical oncology	PURPOSE: The benefit of adjuvant therapy (AT) for biliary tract cancer (BTC) is unclear, with conflicting results from nonrandomized studies. We report a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of AT on survival. METHODS: Studies published between 1960 and November 2010, which evaluated adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy (RT), or both (CRT) compared with curative-intent surgery alone for resected BTC were included. Only tumors of the gallbladder and bile ducts were assessed. Published data were extracted and computed into odds ratios (ORs) for death at 5 years. Subgroup analyses of benefit based on lymph node (LN) or resection margin positivity (R1) were prespecified. Data were weighted by generic inverse variance and pooled using random-effect modeling. RESULTS: Twenty studies involving 6,712 patients were analyzed. There was a nonsignificant improvement in overall survival with any AT compared with surgery alone (pooled OR, 0.74; P = .06). There was no difference between gallbladder and bile duct tumors (P = .68). The association was significant when the two registry analyses were excluded. Those receiving CT or CRT derived statistically greater benefit than RT alone (OR, 0.39, 0.61, and 0.98, respectively; P = .02). The greatest benefit for AT was in those with LN-positive disease (OR, 0.49; P = .004) and R1 disease (OR, 0.36; P = .002). CONCLUSION: This analysis supports AT for BTC. Prospective randomized trials are needed to provide better rationale for this commonly used strategy. On the basis of our data, such trials could involve two active comparators rather than a no-treatment arm among patients with LN-positive or R1 disease.			2012				1394
Risk factors for surgical site infections after breast surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Xue, D. Q., Qian, C., Yang, L. and Wang, X. F.				european journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the european society of surgical oncology and the british association of surgical oncology	european journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the european society of surgical oncology and the british association of surgical oncology	BACKGROUND: Breast surgical site infections (SSIs) are major sources of postoperative morbidity and mortality, and it's established that surveillance of risk factors is effective in reducing hospital-acquired infections. However, studies about risk factors for breast SSIs were still under controversy because of limited data, contradictory results and lack of uniformity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the electronic database of PubMed for case-control studies about risk factors for breast SSIs, and a meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Eight studies including 681 cases and 2064 controls were eligible, and data was combined if the risk factor was studied by at least two studies. Of the 20 possible risk factors involved, 14 were proved significant for SSIs as follows: increased age, hypertension, higher body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, American society of anesthesiologists (ASA) 3 or 4, previous breast biopsy or operation, preoperative chemoradiation, conservation therapy versus other surgical approaches, hematoma, seroma, more intraoperative bleeding, postoperative drain, longer drainage time and second drainage tube placed. However, other factors like smoking habit, immediate reconstruction, axillary lymph node dissection, preoperative chemotherapy, corticosteroid usage and prophylactic antibiotic didn't show statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provided a list of predictable or preventable factors that could be taken measures to reduce the rate of breast SSIs and excluded some negligible factors. This could be useful for developing effective prevention and treatment policies for patients with SSIs and improving the overall quality of life.			2012				1776
The effectiveness of patient-family carer (couple) intervention for the management of symptoms and other health-related problems in people affected by cancer: a systematic literature search and narrative review		Hopkinson, J. B., Brown, J. C., Okamoto, I. and Addington-Hall, J. M.				journal of pain and symptom management	journal of pain and symptom management	CONTEXT: Cancer is widely acknowledged to impact on the whole family. Yet, we do not know if there is benefit (or harm) from patient-family carer interventions in the context of cancer care. OBJECTIVES: To report a systematic search for and narrative review of patient-family carer interventions tested in the context of cancer care for effect on symptoms and other health-related problems in patients and/or their family members. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out using Cochrane principles. Searches were of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases for reported trials of patient-family carer focused interventions. Outcomes of interest were health indicators; measures of physical, psychological, social, and quality-of-life status of the patient and/or family member(s). Limits were English language; 1998 to March 2010; and adults. Relevant information was extracted, quality assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias, and presented as a narrative synthesis (meta-analysis was not appropriate). RESULTS: The review found no empirically tested interventions for family groups (patient and two or more family members), but 22 interventions for patient-family carer partnerships (couple interventions) tested in 23 studies and reported in 27 publications. Recruitment and attrition were problematic in these studies, limiting the reliability and generalizability of their results. CONCLUSION: In the trials of cancer couple interventions included in the review, a pattern emerged of improvement in the emotional health of cancer patients and their carers when the intervention included support for the patient-family carer relationship. Further investigation is warranted.			2012				1472
The ventilator-dependent infant requiring palliative care in the neonatal intensive care unit: a literature review		Foster, Christine and Monterosso, Leanne				neonatal, paediatric & child health nursing	neonatal, paediatric & child health nursing	Aim To review the literature relevant to palliative care of the ventilated infant and their family. Background Impeccable symptom assessment and management is necessary to ensure the optimal quality of life for the ventilated palliative infant and their family. There is a plethora of literature regarding symptom assessment and care when a decision has been made to withdraw ventilatory support. However, there is a lack of literature related to nursing practice for the palliated infant who remains dependent upon ventilatory support until death. Data sources CINAHL, PubMed, Elsevier and Proquest Health and Medical Complete databases were searched (2000-2009). Methods Seventeen articles were reviewed including: 10 research reports; three literature reviews; two discussion papers; one systematic review and one report documenting the development of a paediatric palliative care programme. Results Best practice palliative care requires that care be planned and implemented by an expert multidisciplinary team in collaboration with the infant's parents who should participate in all levels of decision making to ensure optimal care. The need for impeccable symptom assessment was identified as a key factor in the provision of high-quality symptom control. The assumption regarding a paucity of literature surrounding the continuation of family-centred palliative care for those infants who remain on a ventilator until their death was supported. Conclusion and relevance to clinical practice Evidence-based recommendations highlighted in this review may be used as a starting point to formulate neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) clinical guidelines for family-centred palliative care of the ventilator-dependent infant.			2012				2147
Does exercise improve weight loss after bariatric surgery? A systematic review		Egberts, K., Brown, W. A., Brennan, L. and O'Brien, P. E.				obesity surgery	obesity surgery	Bariatric surgery leads to significant weight loss in the obese patient. Exercise has been shown to improve weight loss and body composition in non-surgical weight loss programmes. The role of exercise to improve weight loss following bariatric surgery is unclear. The objective of this review is to systematically appraise the evidence regarding exercise for weight loss in the treatment of obesity in bariatric surgery patients. MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL, EBM Reviews (Cochrane Database, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register) were searched, obesity-related journals were hand-searched and reference lists checked. Studies containing post-surgical patients and exercise were included with the primary outcome of interest being weight loss. A literature search identified 17 publications exploring exercise in bariatric surgery patients. All studies were observational; there were no intervention studies found. The most commonly used instruments to measure activity level were questionnaires followed by telephone interview, surgeon reporting and clinical notes. There was a positive relationship between increased exercise and weight loss after surgery in 15 studies. Meta-analysis demonstrated in patients participating in exercise a standardised mean of 3.62 kg (CI?=?1.28, 5.96) greater weight loss compared to the minimal exercise groups. Observational studies suggest that exercise is associated with greater weight loss following bariatric surgery. Randomised controlled trials are required to further examine this relationship.			2012				1744
The effectiveness of physical activity interventions in socio-economically disadvantaged communities: A systematic review		Cleland, C. L., Tully, M. A., Kee, F. and Cupples, M. E.				preventive medicine	preventive medicine	OBJECTIVE: Interventions to increase levels of physical activity (PA) in socio-economically disadvantaged communities are needed but little is known about their effectiveness. This review examines the effectiveness of interventions designed to increase PA in these communities and the theoretical frameworks and components used. METHODS: Five databases were searched for papers published in English between January 2000 and December 2010 that reported outcomes of PA interventions in socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Studies targeting individuals with pre-existing disease and not reporting a measure of free-living PA were excluded. Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated quality of evidence against pre-defined criteria. RESULTS: Of 478 publications identified, 27 were included. We found that group-based interventions were effective for adults but not for children; evidence for the effectiveness of interventions targeting individuals was insufficient; limited evidence suggested that community-wide interventions produced small changes in PA. Interventions underpinned by any theoretical framework, compared to none, were more likely to be effective. Several effective interventions included education, PA and social support components. CONCLUSION: Compared to other approaches, multi-component adult group-based interventions with theoretical frameworks are most effective in increasing PA in socio-economically disadvantaged communities. More robust evaluations of interventions targeting individuals in these 'hard-to-reach' communities are required.			2012				1793
Effectiveness and safety of methylphenidate and atomoxetine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review		Lv, X. Z., Shu, Z., Zhang, Y. W., Wu, S. S. and Zhan, S. Y.				translational pediatrics	translational pediatrics	OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the effectiveness and safety of methylphenidate immediate-release tablets (IR-MPH), methylphenidate controlled-release tablets (OROS-MPH) and atomoxetine (AHC) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Chinese children. METHODS: Randomized or clinical controlled trials on the effectiveness and safety of IR-MPH, OROS-MPH and AHC for ADHD were searched in electronic databases of CNKI, VIP, CBMDISC online, PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the quality of the included literatures. RESULTS: Eight trials were finally included. IR-MPH, OROS-MPH and AHC were effective for ADHD. OROS-MPH was superior to IR-MPH in the improvement of peer relationship, CGI-I score, mother satisfaction and psychosomatic problems. There were no significant differences in the effectiveness between the AHC and IR-MPH groups. The adverse events related to the therapy with IR-MPH, OROS-MPH or AHC were mild and total incidence rates of adverse events was not significantly different among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of OROS-MPH for the treatment of ADHD is probably superior to IR-MPH, and the effectiveness of AHC and IR-MPH is similar. The three drugs have equivalent safety and good tolerance.			2012				1721
Adesão ao tratamento medicamentoso em pacientes do espectro esquizofrênico: Uma revisão sistemática da literatura		da Silva, Tatiana Fernandes Carpinteiro, Lovisi, Giovanni Marcos, Verdolin, Louise Deluiz and Cavalcanti, Maria Tavares				jornal brasileiro de psiquiatria	jornal brasileiro de psiquiatria	OBJECTIVE: Carry out a systematic review to assess medication adherence among schizophrenic spectrum patients. METHOD: The searches were carried out in the following databases: PubMed/Medline, Lilacs, SciELO and PePSIC considering articles published between 2001 and 2010. In the search strategy were used descriptors according to its definition in the MeSH DeCS: 'schizophrenia' and 'patient adherence' or 'patient compliance' or 'medication adherence'. The correspondence in Portuguese and Spanish were respectively 'esquizofrenia/esquizofrenia' and 'cooperaçãodo paciente/cooperácion delpaciente' or 'adesão à medicação/cumplimientode lá medicación'. Manual searches were also conducted in the references of selected articles. RESULTS: The bibliographic research resulted in 1,692 articles. But only 54 met criteria for compose this review. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies about the theme were conducted in developed countries, hindering the use of these results to our reality. The treatment compliance rates and the methods used for evaluation varied widely, but the factors associated with nonadherence were repeated, such as lack of insight, comorbid substance abuse, lack of social support, medication side effects, violent behavior, homelessness, and suicide attempts. Therefore, there is need of further national studies to investigate potential variables associated with noncompliance and its consequences for the population studied.

Functional outcome following direct repair or intervertebral fusion for adolescent spondylolysis: a systematic review		Westacott, D. J. and Cooke, S. J.				journal of pediatric orthopedics. part b	journal of pediatric orthopedics. part b	A systematic review of the literature was performed to establish whether direct repair of the pars defect or intervertebral fusion achieves better Oswestry Disability Index scores in adolescent spondylolysis or low-grade spondylolisthesis. Nine studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, reporting a minimum total of 80 direct repairs and 108 fusions because of presumed replication of data between studies. Little statistically or clinically significant difference could be established between the two interventions. The only comparative study showed improved long-term outcome with fusion. Further well-designed prospective comparative studies are required to establish the optimum treatment for this condition.			2012				1068
The effects of eccentric training on lower limb flexibility: a systematic review		O'Sullivan, K., McAuliffe, S. and Deburca, N.				british journal of sports medicine	british journal of sports medicine	BACKGROUND: Reduced flexibility has been documented in athletes with lower limb injury, however, stretching has limited evidence of effectiveness in preventing injury or reducing the risk of recurrence. In contrast, it has been proposed that eccentric training can improve strength and reduce the risk of injury, and facilitate increased muscle flexibility via sarcomerogenesis. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review was undertaken to examine the evidence that eccentric training has demonstrated effectiveness as a means of improving lower limb flexibility. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Six electronic databases were systematically searched by two independent reviewers to identify randomised clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of eccentric training to either a different intervention, or a no-intervention control group. Studies evaluating flexibility using both joint range of motion (ROM) and muscle fascicle length (FL) were included. Six studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and were appraised using the PEDro scale. Differences in the muscles studied, and the outcome measures used, did not allow for pooled analysis. RESULTS: There was consistent, strong evidence from all six trials in three different muscle groups that eccentric training can improve lower limb flexibility, as assessed using either joint ROM or muscle FL. CONCLUSION: The results support the hypothesis that eccentric training is an effective method of increasing lower limb flexibility. Further research is required to compare the increased flexibility obtained after eccentric training to that obtained with static stretching and other exercise interventions.			2012				1320
Improving patient handovers from hospital to primary care: a systematic review		Hesselink, G., Schoonhoven, L., Barach, P., Spijker, A., Gademan, P., Kalkman, C., Liefers, J., Vernooij-Dassen, M. and Wollersheim, H.				annals of internal medicine	annals of internal medicine	BACKGROUND: Evidence shows that suboptimum handovers at hospital discharge lead to increased rehospitalizations and decreased quality of health care. PURPOSE: To systematically review interventions that aim to improve patient discharge from hospital to primary care. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were searched for studies published between January 1990 and March 2011. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials of interventions that aimed to improve handovers between hospital and primary care providers at hospital discharge. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently abstracted data on study objectives, setting and design, intervention characteristics, and outcomes. Studies were categorized according to methodological quality, sample size, intervention characteristics, outcome, statistical significance, and direction of effects. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 36 included studies, 25 (69.4%) had statistically significant effects in favor of the intervention group and 34 (94.4%) described multicomponent interventions. Effective interventions included medication reconciliation; electronic tools to facilitate quick, clear, and structured summary generation; discharge planning; shared involvement in follow-up by hospital and community care providers; use of electronic discharge notifications; and Web-based access to discharge information for general practitioners. Statistically significant effects were mostly found in reducing hospital use (for example, rehospitalizations), improvement of continuity of care (for example, accurate discharge information), and improvement of patient status after discharge (for example, satisfaction). LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity of the interventions and study characteristics made meta-analysis impossible. Most studies had diffuse aims and poor descriptions of the specific intervention components. CONCLUSION: Many interventions have positive effects on patient care. However, given the complexity of interventions and outcome measures, the literature does not permit firm conclusions about which interventions have these effects.

Induction of lucid dreams: a systematic review of evidence		Stumbrys, T., Erlacher, D., Schädlich, M. and Schredl, M.				consciousness and cognition	consciousness and cognition	In lucid dreams the dreamer is aware of dreaming and often able to influence the ongoing dream content. Lucid dreaming is a learnable skill and a variety of techniques is suggested for lucid dreaming induction. This systematic review evaluated the evidence for the effectiveness of induction techniques. A comprehensive literature search was carried out in biomedical databases and specific resources. Thirty-five studies were included in the analysis (11 sleep laboratory and 24 field studies), of which 26 employed cognitive techniques, 11 external stimulation and one drug application. The methodological quality of the included studies was relatively low. None of the induction techniques were verified to induce lucid dreams reliably and consistently, although some of them look promising. On the basis of the reviewed studies, a taxonomy of lucid dream induction methods is presented. Several methodological issues are discussed and further directions for future studies are proposed.			2012				968
Wound healing in the upper and lower extremities: a systematic review on the use of acellular dermal matrices		Iorio, M. L., Shuck, J. and Attinger, C. E.				plastic and reconstructive surgery	plastic and reconstructive surgery	BACKGROUND: Use of biologically engineered acellular dermal matrices in the upper and lower extremities is increasingly recognized as a means of achieving definitive healing in the setting of both acute and chronic injuries but data and evidence supporting their use are limited. The authors performed this systematic review to identify all available evidence for the use of matrices in nonburn extremity reconstruction. METHODS: A systematic review of the Cochrane and MEDLINE databases was performed to identify all reports of the application of matrices in wounds of the upper and lower extremities. Reports that included fewer than five patients and that involved cellular seeding, nonhuman studies, and burn injuries were excluded. Studies were evaluated for quality of statistical measures and outcomes, and a level of evidence was assigned in accordance with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons' Rating Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: Of an initial 2422 reports, 13 primary reports were identified (10 case series and three randomized controlled trials) representing a total of 432 patients and 441 discrete wounds. After evidence review, 10 of these studies represented level IV evidence, two studies represented level II evidence, and one study achieved level I evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Extremity wound management continues to rely on adequate vascular supply, débridement with eradication of infection, off-loading, and/or immobilization. Current data, although limited, appear to support the use of acellular dermal matrices in chronic and acute injuries where there is exposed bone, tendon, and/or muscle. They may provide a simple technique to achieve timely and durable tissue coverage in extremity wounds.			2012				1399
Periodontal disease as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies		Corbella, S., Taschieri, S., Francetti, L., De Siena, F. and Del Fabbro, M.				odontology / the society of the nippon dental university	odontology / the society of the nippon dental university	Periodontal disease is a highly prevalent group of illnesses of microbial etiology, whose consequence is a severe breakdown of tooth-supporting structures. A link between periodontal infection and several systemic conditions, among which adverse pregnancy outcomes, has been suggested in the recent years. The aim of this review based on case-control studies was to evaluate if periodontal disease could be considered as a risk factor for preterm birth, low birth-weight and preterm low birth-weight. An electronic search (via Pubmed) was performed for case-control studies investigating the relationship between periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. From the initially retrieved 417 articles, 17 case-control studies, accounting for a total of 10,148 patients, were included in the review and in the meta-analysis. The estimated odds ratio was 1.78 (CI 95%: 1.58, 2.01) for preterm birth, 1.82 (CI 95%: 1.51, 1.20) for low birth-weight and 3.00 (CI 95%: 1.93, 4.68) for preterm low birth-weight. Despite the results of the analysis of pooled data suggested a link between periodontal diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes, the presence of important confounders, whose effect could not be addressed, prevents a validation of the meta-analysis outcomes. Further more accurate investigations based on individual data analysis could give a better insight into the topic of the present review.			2012				1954
Systematic review of teleneurology: methodology		Rubin, M. N., Wellik, K. E., Channer, D. D. and Demaerschalk, B. M.				frontiers in neurology	frontiers in neurology	"BACKGROUND: The use of two-way audio-visual technology for delivery of acute stroke is supported by a well established literature base. The use of telemedicine for general neurologic consultation has been reported across most subspecialties within the field, but a comprehensive systematic review of these reports is lacking. PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic review of the published literature on teleneurologic consultation beyond stroke. DATA SOURCES: Databases Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane were searched with keywords, ""teleneurology,"" and numerous synonyms and cross-referenced with neurology subspecialties. The search yielded 6,615 potentially eligible hits, which were independently reviewed by two investigators. Ultimately 375 unique studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if the title or abstract expressed use of two-way AV communication for a clinical neurologic indication other than stroke. DATA EXTRACTION: Each article was classified using a novel scoring rubric to assess the level of functionality, application, technology, and evaluative stage. DATA ANALYSIS: Articles were hierarchized within a subspecialty category. Overall subspecialty scores were assigned based on aggregate of scores across papers in each category. CONCLUSION: Use of telemedicine for general and most subspecialty neurologic consultation, beyond stroke, appears very promising but the clinical science is nascent."			2012				928
A systematic review: influence of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration		Autier, P., Gandini, S. and Mullie, P.				the journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism	the journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism	CONTEXT: Few studies in subjects over 50 yr of age have evaluated the influence of variable doses of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. OBJECTIVE: We performed a meta-analysis of changes in circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D level associated with vitamin D supplementation in Caucasian subjects over 50 yr old. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a systematic search in literature databases and in references of past reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized placebo or open-label trials that evaluated the influence of vitamin D supplementation on clinical outcomes were included in the study. DATA EXTRACTION: We reviewed trial characteristics and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations at baseline and during the trial. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seventy-six trials published from 1984 to March 2011 included 6207 subjects allocated to 101 intervention groups that tested supplement doses ranging from 5 to 250 ?g/d (median, 20 ?g/d). For similar doses, trials could obtain increases in 25-hydroxyvitamin D three to four times lower than other trials. A meta-regression showed that in the absence of concomitant use of calcium supplements, the average increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations was 0.78 ng/ml (1.95 nmol/liter) per microgram of vitamin D3 supplement per day. Compared to the vitamin D3, the vitamin D2 was associated with significantly lower increases (P = 0.03). Concomitant use of calcium supplementation and high 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at baseline was nonsignificantly associated with lower increases in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary recommendations and randomized trials on vitamin D supplementation should evaluate whether increases in circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels match expectations--for instance, the average increases obtained by trials on vitamin D3 without concomitant calcium supplements.			2012				1881
Efficacy of Interventions Promoting Blood Donation: A Systematic Review		Godin, G., Vézina-Im, L. A., Bélanger-Gravel, A. and Amireault, S.				transfusion medicine reviews	transfusion medicine reviews	Findings about the efficacy of interventions promoting blood donation are scattered and sometime inconsistent. The aim of the present systematic review was to identify the most effective types of interventions and modes of delivery to increase blood donation. The following databases were investigated: MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Proquest Dissertations and Theses. Additional studies were also included by checking the references of the articles included in the review and by looking at our personal collection. The outcomes of interest were either blood drive attendance or blood donations. A total of 29 randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies were included in the review, detailing 36 interventions tested among independent samples. Interventions targeting psychosocial cognitions (s = 8, s to represent the number of independent samples; odds ratio [OR], 2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-4.28), those stressing the altruistic motives to give blood (s = 4; OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 1.03-14.76), and reminders (s = 7; OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.22-2.99) were the most successful in increasing blood donation. The results suggest that motivational interventions and reminders are the most effective in increasing blood donation, but additional studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of other types of interventions.			2012				963
Efficacy and safety of long-term botulinum toxin treatment in craniocervical dystonia: a systematic review		Colosimo, C., Tiple, D. and Berardelli, A.				neurotoxicity research	neurotoxicity research	Botulinum neurotoxins have been shown to be a safe and effective therapeutic option for most forms of focal dystonia, and are now considered to provide the best symptomatic treatment in these disorders. However, only a few papers addressed the long-term efficacy and safety of repeated treatments with this drug. This article reviews the data from clinical trials that have assessed the long-term results of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) and type B in the treatment of the different forms of focal craniocervical dystonia, cervical dystonia (CD), blepharospasm, oromandibular, and laryngeal dystonia. Studies on the long-term effects of BoNT-A therapy have demonstrated that the majority of patients comply with this repeated treatment because they experience a positive and stable effect over time. It is still unclear whether in patients with focal dystonia the mean dose of BoNT-A changes over time. In spite of the wide spectrum of side effects reported to be associated with BoNT-A treatment, there is no evidence of specific side effects due exclusively to the long-term use of such drugs. The only exception to these positive long-term findings is the occurrence of a subgroup of patients with CD who fail to maintain a sustained response after the first or second effective treatment, partly owing to the development of neutralizing antibodies against the toxin. Longitudinal studies aimed at defining the risk factors for this abnormal pattern of response to botulinum toxin treatment are currently being conducted.			2012				1709
Safety of Pain Therapy During Pregnancy and Lactation in Patients with Inflammatory Arthritis: A Systematic Literature Review		Adams, Karen, Bombardier, Claire and Van Der Heijde, Désirée				journal of rheumatology	journal of rheumatology	Objective. To systematically review the efficacy and safety of on-demand versus continuous use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) in patients with inflammatory arthritis and to assess if longterm continuous treatment with NSAID in comparison with NSAID treatment on-demand reduces radiographic progression. Methods. A systematic literature review was performed in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 2008DS2009 meeting abstracts as part of the multinational 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative for generating practical recommendations about Pain Management by Pharmacotherapy in Inflammatory Arthritis. Articles fulfilling predefined inclusion criteria were reviewed and quality appraisal was performed. Results. The search yielded a total of 1410 articles from Medline and Embase, 73 from Cochrane Central, and 3 meeting abstracts. After review, only one study fulfilled the defined inclusion criteria, which indicated that longterm continuous treatment with NSAID versus NSAID treatment on-demand reduced radiographic progression in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Secondary measured endpoints were disease activity measures including pain and the frequency of observed adverse events in both groups. Relevant adverse events tended to occur more frequently in the continuous treatment group with odds ratios of 2.79 for hypertension, 1.67 for abdominal pain, 1.35 for diarrhea, 0.95 for dyspepsia, and 3.2 for depression. None of these differences were statistically significant, with the exception of depression, which could not be explained. Conclusion. Based on a single study, there does not seem to be a statistical difference in efficacy between the on-demand versus continuous use of NSAID in the context of ankylosing spondylitis. There were no studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or spondyloarthritis. Research is needed to study the risk-benefit ratio of continuous versus on-demand use of NSAID.			2012				1455
Efficacy and safety of novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: direct and adjusted indirect meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials		Fox, B. D., Kahn, S. R., Langleben, D., Eisenberg, M. J. and Shimony, A.				bmj (clinical research ed.)	bmj (clinical research ed.)	OBJECTIVE: To critically review the effectiveness of the novel oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, ximelagatran, and apixaban) in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. DESIGN: Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis. Data were extracted independently by two investigators. An adjusted indirect comparison was performed to compare between novel oral anticoagulants. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to April 2012). Hand searching of relevant scientific works and contact with experts. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials of novel oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists for acute venous thromboembolism. Selected outcomes were recurrent events, major bleeding, and all cause mortality. RESULTS: Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, involving 16,701 patients evaluated for efficacy and 16,611 for safety. Data were stratified according to different novel oral anticoagulants. For recurrent acute venous thromboembolism, there were no significant differences in events rates between any of the anticoagulants and conventional treatment (rivaroxaban (four studies): relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.31; dabigatran (two studies): 1.09, 0.76 to 1.57; ximelagatran (two studies): 1.06, 0.62 to 1.80; and apixaban (one study): 0.98, 0.20 to 4.79). Rivaroxaban reduced the risk of major bleeding compared with conventional treatment (0.57, 0.39 to 0.84), whereas other novel oral anticoagulants did not (0.76 (0.49 to 1.18) for dabigatran; 0.54 (0.28 to 1.03) for ximelagatran; 2.95 (0.12 to 71.82) for apixaban). For all cause mortality there were no significant differences between the novel oral anticoagulants and conventional treatment (0.96 (0.72 to 1.27) for rivaroxaban; 1.00 (0.67 to 1.50) for dabigatran; 0.67 (0.42 to 1.08) for ximelagatran; 6.89 (0.36 to 132.06) for apixaban). The adjusted indirect comparison between rivaroxaban and dabigatran did not show superiority of either drug over the others for major bleeding (0.75, 0.41 to 1.34) or the other endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with vitamin K antagonists, the novel oral anticoagulants had a similar risk of recurrence of acute venous thromboembolism and all cause mortality, though rivaroxaban was associated with a reduced risk of bleeding.			2012				2457
How to communicate with the public about chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear terrorism: a systematic review of the literature		Rubin, G. J., Chowdhury, A. K. and Amlôt, R.				biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science	biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science	A deliberate attack involving chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) material has the potential to cause substantial fear among the public. This presents problems for communicators, who will need to provide information quickly after an attack while ensuring that their messages are easily understood and likely to be attended to by members of the public. Identifying in advance what people would want to know, where they would get information from, and how messages should be presented might allow communicators to ensure that their messages have the best chance of having their desired effect. In this review, we identified all peer-reviewed studies that have assessed communication strategies or information needs using hypothetical CBRN scenarios or in actual CBRN incidents. We identified 33 relevant studies. Their results support existing psychological models of why people engage in health protective behaviors, with information about the severity of the incident, the likelihood of being exposed, the efficacy and costs or risks of recommended behaviors, and the ability of individuals to perform recommended behaviors being sought by the public. Trust plays a crucial role in ensuring that people attend to messages. Finally, while a large variety of spokespeople and sources were identified as being turned to in the event of an incident, the use of multiple information sources was also common, affirming the importance of communicating a consistent message through multiple channels. Further research is required to extend these predominantly US-based findings to other countries and to confirm the findings of research using hypothetical scenarios.			2012				1937
Operative Versus Nonoperative Management of Acute Achilles Tendon Ruptures: A Quantitative Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials		Wilkins, R. and Bisson, L. J.				the american journal of sports medicine	the american journal of sports medicine	BACKGROUND: Despite several randomized controlled trials comparing operative to nonoperative management of Achilles tendon ruptures, the optimal management of this condition remains the subject of significant debate. Rerupture is a known complication, but most level I studies have not shown a significant difference in the incidence of reruptures when comparing operative to nonoperative management. PURPOSE: The goal of this systematic review was to identify all randomized controlled trials comparing operative and nonoperative management of Achilles tendon ruptures and to meta-analyze the data with reruptures being the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes including strength, time to return to work, and other complications were analyzed as well. STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched multiple online databases to identify English-language, prospective randomized controlled trials comparing open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon ruptures to nonoperative management. Rerupture was our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included strength, time to return to work, deep infections, sural nerve sensory disturbances, noncosmetic scar complaints, and deep venous thrombosis. Coleman methodology scores were calculated for each included study. Data were extracted from all qualifying articles and, when appropriate, pooled and meta-analyzed. RESULTS: Seven level I trials involving 677 patients met inclusion criteria. Coleman scores were 95, 95, 95, 89, 78, 97, and 92. Open repair was associated with a significantly lower rerupture rate compared with nonoperative treatment (3.6% vs 8.8%; odds ratio, 0.425; 95% confidence interval, 0.222-0.815). The incidence of deep infections was significantly higher for patients treated with surgery (P = .0113). The incidences of noncosmetic scar complaints and sural nerve sensory disturbances were also significantly higher in patients treated with surgery (P < .001 for each). Strength measurements were not standardized and therefore could not be meta-analyzed. CONCLUSION: Open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon ruptures significantly reduces the risk of reruptures when compared with nonoperative management. Several other complications, which are clearly avoided with nonoperative treatment, occur with a significantly higher incidence when surgical repair is performed. The available literature makes it difficult to compare the return of strength in the involved lower extremity after operative or nonoperative management. Future studies may focus on testing strength in a more functional and reproducible manner than isokinetic testing.			2012				1542
Common needs but divergent interventions for U.S. homeless and foster care children: results from a systematic review		Zlotnick, C., Tam, T. and Zerger, S.				health & social care in the community	health & social care in the community	Many children living in homeless situations in the U.S. have temporary stays in foster care, and both populations suffer disproportionately higher rates of physical, psychological and social difficulties compared with other children. However, very little is known about which specific interventions achieve the best outcomes for children in these overlapping transitional living situations. To address this gap, we review existing literature to identify the most promising practices for children living in transition. A standardised vocabulary specific to each of three electronic databases (i.e. Medline, PsychINFO and CINAHL) was employed to identify studies that described an intervention specifically targeting foster care or homeless children and families. Separate systematic searches were conducted for homeless and foster children, and only studies published in English between January 1993 and February 2009 were selected. The final sample ( n = 43) of articles described interventions that fell into two categories: mental health ( n = 17) and case management ( n = 26). No article included a sample containing both homeless and foster care children, and most studies on homeless children used case management interventions while most studies on foster care children focused on mental health interventions. Few articles employed rigorous study designs. Although repeatedly studies have demonstrated the overlap between populations of homeless and foster care children, studies focused on one population or the other. Virtually all studies on both homeless and foster children devised interventions to reduce trauma and family instability; yet, no evidence-based practice addresses the overlapping needs and potentially relevant evidence-based practice for these two populations. An important and vital next step is to establish an effective evidence-based intervention that reduces the impact of trauma on both U.S. populations of children living in transition.			2012				1525
Percutaneous coronary intervention versus optimal medical therapy in stable coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials		Pursnani, S., Korley, F., Gopaul, R., Kanade, P., Chandra, N., Shaw, R. E. and Bangalore, S.				circulation. cardiovascular interventions	circulation. cardiovascular interventions	BACKGROUND: The role of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the management of stable coronary artery disease remains controversial. Given advancements in medical therapies and stent technology over the last decade, we sought to evaluate whether PCI, when added to medical therapy, improves outcomes when compared with medical therapy alone. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases, until January 2012, for randomized clinical trials comparing revascularization with PCI to optimal medical therapy (OMT) in patients with stable coronary artery disease. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, subsequent revascularization, and freedom from angina. Primary analyses were based on longest available follow-up with secondary analyses stratified by trial duration, with short-term (?1 year), intermediate (1-5 years), and long-term (?5 years) time points. We identified 12 randomized clinical trials enrolling 7182 participants who fulfilled our inclusion criteria. For the primary analyses, when compared with OMT, PCI was associated with no significant improvement in mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71-1.01), cardiac death (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.06), nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.70-1.24), or repeat revascularization (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.76-1.14), with consistent results over all follow-up time points. Sensitivity analysis restricted to studies in which there was >50% stent use showed attenuation in the effect size for all-cause mortality (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78-1.11) with PCI. However, for freedom from angina, there was a significant improved outcome with PCI, as compared with the OMT group (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06-1.37), evident at all of the follow-up time points. CONCLUSIONS: In this most rigorous and comprehensive analysis in patients with stable coronary artery disease, PCI, as compared with OMT, did not reduce the risk of mortality, cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization. PCI, however, provided a greater angina relief compared with OMT alone, larger studies with sufficient power are required to prove this conclusively.			2012				1589
Vasopressors for the management of hypotension after spinal anesthesia for elective caesarean section. Systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis		Veeser, M., Hofmann, T., Roth, R., Klöhr, S., Rossaint, R. and Heesen, M.				acta anaesthesiologica scandinavica	acta anaesthesiologica scandinavica	BACKGROUND: Phenylephrine use has been recommended over ephedrine for the management of hypotension after spinal anesthesia for elective caesarean section. The evidence for this is rather limited because in previous trials, pH was significantly lower after ephedrine, but absolute values were still within normal range. We pooled the available data to define maternal and neonatal effects of the two vasopressors. METHODS: Literature was identified by a systematic search. Hypotension, hypertension, and bradycardia of the mothers, fetal acidosis defined as a pH?<?7.20, and the continuous variables base excess (BE) and arterial pCO(2) of the neonates were recorded. Meta-analysis using the random effects model was performed, and the weighted mean difference (WMD) or risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: The criteria for eligibility were fulfilled by 20 trials including 1069 patients. The RR of true fetal acidosis was 5.29 (95%CI 1.62-17.25, ) for ephedrine vs. phenylephrine (P?=?0.006). BE values after ephedrine use were significantly lower than after phenylephrine (WMD -1.17; 95% CI -2.01 - -0.33). Umbilical artery pCO(2) did not differ. Mothers treated with ephedrine had a lower risk for bradycardia (RR 0.17; 95%CI 0.07-0.43; P?=?0.004). No differences between vasopressors were observed for hypotension and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis could clearly demonstrate a decreased risk of fetal acidosis associated with phenylephrine use. In addition with our findings for BE, this suggests a favorable effect of phenylephrine on fetal outcome parameters. The mechanism of pH depression is not related to pCO(2) .			2012				2003
Ephedrine versus phenylephrine for the management of hypotension during spinal anesthesia for cesarean section: an updated meta-analysis		Lin, F. Q., Qiu, M. T., Ding, X. X., Fu, S. K. and Li, Q.				cns neuroscience & therapeutics	cns neuroscience & therapeutics	AIMS: A systematic literature review comparing the efficacy of ephedrine and phenylephrine for the management of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension during Cesarean sections (C-sections) was published in 2002. A number of well-designed trials with controversial results have been published afterward. Therefore, an updated meta-analysis was necessary. METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched (last search performed on September 26, 2011). Pooled risk ratio (RR) or standard mean difference (SMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for the incidence of intra-operative hypotension or umbilical blood pH values. RESULTS: A total number of 15 trials and 742 parturients under elective C-sections were analyzed. When used to prevent hypotension, patients receiving ephedrine and phenylephrine did not differ significantly in the incidence of hypotension (RR = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.83-1.80), umbilical arterial pH values (SMD = -0.38; 95% CI, -1.67 to 0.92) or venous pH values (SMD = -0.18; 95% CI, -0.44 to 0.07). And administration routes did not affect the incidence of hypotension and umbilical blood pH values. When used to treat hypotension, patients given ephedrine and phenylephrine had comparable incidence of intra-operative hypotension (RR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.56), while parturients receiving phenylephrine had neonates with higher umbilical arterial pH values (SMD = -1.32; 95% CI, -2.35 to -0.30) and venous pH values (SMD = -0.79; 95% CI, -1.09 to -0.49) than those given ephedrine. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic use of ephedrine and phenylephrine were both effective in preventing maternal hypotension during C-section under spinal anesthesia; phenylephrine was superior to ephedrine in treating hypotension, evidenced by higher umbilical blood pH values.			2012				2499
Anti-diabetic medications and the risk of hepatocellular cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Singh, S., Singh, P. P., Singh, A. G., Murad, M. H. and Sanchez, W.				the american journal of gastroenterology	the american journal of gastroenterology	Several preclinical and observational studies have shown that anti-diabetic medications (ADMs) can modify the risk of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). We performed a systematic review and meta-analyses of studies evaluating the effect of metformin, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), sulfonylureas, and/or insulin on the risk of HCC. We conducted a systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to August 2012. Studies were included if they (1) evaluated and clearly defined exposure to metformin, TZDs, sulfonylureas, and/or insulin, (2) reported HCC outcomes in patients with DM, and (3) reported relative risks or odds ratio (OR) or provided data for their estimation. Summary OR estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the random-effects model. Ten studies reporting 22,650 cases of HCC in 334,307 patients with type 2 DM were included in the analysis. Meta-analysis of observational studies showed a 50% reduction in HCC incidence with metformin use (n=8 studies; OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.73), 62% and 161% increase in HCC incidence with sulfonylurea (n=8 studies; OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.16-2.24) or insulin use (n=7; OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.46-4.65), respectively. TZDs did not modify the risk of HCC (n=4; OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.28-1.02). There was considerable heterogeneity across studies, which was partly explained by study setting, location, and whether the studies adjusted for the concomitant use of other ADMs. Post-hoc analysis of randomized controlled trials did not reveal any significant association between ADM use and risk of HCC. ADMs may modify the risk of HCC in patients with DM, especially in the Western population. However, the effect of each individual agent should be interpreted with caution owing to inherent cancer-modifying effect of the comparator group.			2013				2853
Intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate for treating acute asthma in adults and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Shan, Z., Rong, Y., Yang, W., Wang, D., Yao, P., Xie, J. and Liu, L.				respiratory medicine	respiratory medicine	OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the effects of intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate on treating adults and children with acute asthma. METHODS: Electronic literature search and the manual search of key respiratory journals were performed up to October 18, 2011. Randomized controlled trials were included if patients had been treated with intravenous or nebulized magnesium sulfate in combination with ?2-agonists and were compared with the use of ?2-agonists. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and the relative risks (RRs) were calculated for pulmonary functions and hospital admission respectively. RESULTS: 25 trials (16 intravenous, 9 nebulized) involving 1754 patients were included. In adults intravenous treatment was associated with a significant effect upon respiratory function (SMD, 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.05 to 0.55; p = 0.02) but weak evidence of effect upon hospital admission (RR 0.86,95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; p = 0.06) in adults, and in children with significant effects upon both respiratory function (SMD, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.80 to 3.08; p = 0.0008) and hospital admission (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; p = 0.008). Nebulized treatment was associated with significant effects upon respiratory function (SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.41; p = 0.009) and hospital admission (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.92; p = 0.02) in adults. CONCLUSION: The use of intravenous magnesium sulfate, in addition to ?2-agonists and systemic steroids, in the treatment of acute asthma appears to produce benefits with respect to improve pulmonary function and reduce the number of hospital admissions for children, and only improve pulmonary function for adults. However, the use of nebulized magnesium sulfate just appears to produce benefits for adults.			2013				3143
Advantages and disadvantages of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC) compared to other central venous lines: A systematic review of the literature		Johansson, E., Hammarskjöld, F., Lundberg, D. and Arnlind, M. H.				acta oncologica (stockholm, sweden)	acta oncologica (stockholm, sweden)	Background. The use of central venous lines carries a significant risk for serious complications and high economic costs. Lately, the peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) has gained in popularity due to presumed advantages over other central venous lines. The aim of this systematic literature review was to identify scientific evidence justifying the use of PICC. Material and methods. The literature review was performed according to the principles of Cochrane Collaboration. The electronic literature search included common databases up to March 2011. Only those studies rated as high or moderate quality were used for grading of evidence and conclusions. Results. The search resulted in 827 abstracts, 48 articles were read in full text, and 11 met the inclusion criteria. None of the articles was classified as high quality and two had moderate quality. The results of these two studies indicate that PICC increases the risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), but decreases the risk for catheter occlusion. The quality of scientific evidence behind these conclusions, however, was limited. Due to the lack of studies with sufficiently high quality, questions such as early complications, patient satisfaction and costs could not be answered. Discussion. We conclude that although PICCs are frequently used in oncology, scientific evidence supporting any advantage or disadvantage of PICC when comparing PICC with traditional central venous lines is limited, apart from a tendency towards increased risk for DVT and a decreased risk for catheter occlusion with PICC.			2013				3192
Vaginal progesterone vs cervical cerclage for the prevention of preterm birth in women with a sonographic short cervix, previous preterm birth, and singleton gestation: a systematic review and indirect comparison metaanalysis		Conde-Agudelo, A., Romero, R., Nicolaides, K., Chaiworapongsa, T., O'Brien, J. M., Cetingoz, E., da Fonseca, E., Creasy, G., Soma-Pillay, P., Fusey, S., Cam, C., Alfirevic, Z. and Hassan, S. S.				american journal of obstetrics and gynecology	american journal of obstetrics and gynecology	OBJECTIVE: No randomized controlled trial has compared vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage directly for the prevention of preterm birth in women with a sonographic short cervix in the mid trimester, singleton gestation, and previous spontaneous preterm birth. We performed an indirect comparison of vaginal progesterone vs cerclage using placebo/no cerclage as the common comparator. STUDY DESIGN: Adjusted indirect metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: Four studies that evaluated vaginal progesterone vs placebo (158 patients) and 5 studies that evaluated cerclage vs no cerclage (504 patients) were included. Both interventions were associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of preterm birth at <32 weeks of gestation and composite perinatal morbidity and mortality compared with placebo/no cerclage. Adjusted indirect metaanalyses did not show statistically significant differences between vaginal progesterone and cerclage in the reduction of preterm birth or adverse perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSION: Based on state-of-the-art methods for indirect comparisons, either vaginal progesterone or cerclage are equally efficacious in the prevention of preterm birth in women with a sonographic short cervix in the mid trimester, singleton gestation, and previous preterm birth. Selection of the optimal treatment needs to consider adverse events, cost and patient/clinician preferences.			2013				3666
A novel model-based meta-analysis to indirectly estimate the comparative efficacy of two medications: an example using DPP-4 inhibitors, sitagliptin and linagliptin, in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus		Gross, J. L., Rogers, J., Polhamus, D., Gillespie, W., Friedrich, C., Gong, Y., Monz, B. U., Patel, S., Staab, A. and Retlich, S.				bmj open	bmj open	OBJECTIVES: To develop a longitudinal statistical model to indirectly estimate the comparative efficacies of two drugs, using model-based meta-analysis (MBMA). Comparison of two oral dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, sitagliptin and linagliptin, for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment was used as an example. DESIGN: Systematic review with MBMA. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane review of DPP-4 inhibitors for T2DM, sitagliptin trials on Food and Drug Administration website to December 2011 and linagliptin data from the manufacturer. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trials, ?12 weeks' duration, that analysed sitagliptin or linagliptin efficacies as changes in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, in adults with T2DM and HbA1c >7%, irrespective of background medication. MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION: A Bayesian model was fitted (Markov Chain Monte Carlo method). The final model described HbA1c levels as function of time, dose, baseline HbA1c, washout status/duration and ethnicity. Other covariates showed no major impact on model parameters and were not included. For the indirect comparison, a population of 1000 patients was simulated from the model with a racial composition reflecting the average racial distribution of the linagliptin trials, and baseline HbA1c of 8%. RESULTS: The model was developed using longitudinal data from 11 234 patients (10 linagliptin, 15 sitagliptin trials), and assessed by internal evaluation techniques, demonstrating that the model adequately described the observations. Simulations showed both linagliptin 5 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.81% (placebo-adjusted) at week 24. Credible intervals for participants without washout were -0.88 to -0.75 (linagliptin) and -0.89 to -0.73 (sitagliptin), and for those with washout, -0.91 to -0.76 (linagliptin) and -0.91 to -0.75 (sitagliptin). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the use of longitudinal MBMA in the field of diabetes treatment. Based on an example evaluating HbA1c reduction with linagliptin versus sitagliptin, the model used seems a valid approach for indirect drug comparisons.			2013				3826
Total Skin-Sparing Mastectomy: A Systematic Review of Oncologic Outcomes and Postoperative Complications		Piper, M., Peled, A. W., Foster, R. D., Moore, D. H. and Esserman, L. J.				annals of plastic surgery	annals of plastic surgery	INTRODUCTION: Despite the potential aesthetic and psychological benefits of total skin-sparing mastectomy (TSSM) with preservation of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) skin, there is still reluctance to use the technique due to concern for increased recurrence rates or higher postoperative complication rates. The rapidly expanding literature describing outcomes after TSSM enables a comprehensive review of recurrence rates and surgical complications. METHODS: Studies describing nipple-sparing or TSSM were identified from the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases. Studies that reported oncologic outcomes and/or data on postoperative complications were included. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were identified that met inclusion criteria, representing a total of 3331 mastectomies. Review of oncologic outcomes in the 10 studies (representing 1148 mastectomies) with documented mean/median follow-up of 2 years demonstrated an overall local-regional recurrence rate of 2.8%. Ischemic complications involving the NAC were reported in 24 studies (representing 3091 mastectomies), with 9.1% of cases reported to have some degree of NAC necrosis and 2.0% of cases complicated by complete necrosis leading to NAC loss. Sixteen studies (representing 2213 mastectomies) reported rates of skin flap necrosis, which occurred in 9.5% of cases. Eighty-one percent of the total cases reviewed involved expander-implant reconstruction; in the 16 studies (representing 2343 reconstructions) that reported outcomes after expander-implant reconstruction, overall expander-implant loss was 3.4%. CONCLUSIONS: There is now a significant body of literature demonstrating low rates of early local-regional recurrence and postoperative complications after TSSM. These data support the use of TSSM techniques, which improve psychological and aesthetic outcomes without compromising therapeutic efficacy.			2013				3353
Systematic review and meta-analysis of prophylactic antibiotics in COPD and/or chronic bronchitis		Lee, J. S., Park, D. A., Hong, Y., Jo, K. W., Lee, S. W., Huh, J. W., Oh, Y. M. and Lee, S. D.				the international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the international union against tuberculosis and lung disease	the international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the international union against tuberculosis and lung disease	BACKGROUND: Exacerbations contribute substantially to the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OBJECTIVES: To assess whether prophylactic antibiotic treatment reduces exacerbations in patients with COPD and/or chronic bronchitis. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Koreamed and references from relevant publications were searched up to October 2011. Randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of any prophylactic antibiotics with placebo for at least 3 months were included. The co-primary outcomes were the frequency of exacerbations of COPD or chronic bronchitis and adverse treatment events. RESULTS: A total of 19 trials involving 3932 subjects were included in the analysis: 5 recent trials included patients with moderate to severe COPD, whereas 14 older trials included patients with chronic bronchitis. The use of antibiotics significantly reduced the rate of COPD exacerbations (risk ratio [RR] 0.73, 95%CI 0.66-0.82), the number of chronic bronchitis exacerbations (standardised mean difference -0.23, 95%CI -0.35--0.11) and the proportion of patients with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (RR 0.93, 95%CI 0.87-0.99). CONCLUSION: Prophylactic antibiotic treatment has a significant effect in reducing exacerbations in patients with COPD and/or chronic bronchitis.			2013				3358
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with H1N1 influenza infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis including 8 studies and 266 patients receiving ECMO		Zangrillo, A., Biondi-Zoccai, G., Landoni, G., Frati, G., Patroniti, N., Pesenti, A. and Pappalardo, F.				critical care (london, england)	critical care (london, england)	INTRODUCTION: H1N1 influenza can cause severe acute lung injury (ALI). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on ECMO for H1N1-associated ALI. METHODS: CENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus (updated 2 January 2012) were systematically searched. Studies reporting on 10 or more patients with H1N1 infection treated with ECMO were included. Baseline, procedural, outcome and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled, when appropriate, with random-effect methods. RESULTS: From 1,196 initial citations, 8 studies were selected, including 1,357 patients with confirmed/suspected H1N1 infection requiring intensive care unit admission, 266 (20%) of whom were treated with ECMO. Patients had a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 9, and had received mechanical ventilation before ECMO implementation for a median of two days. ECMO was implanted before inter-hospital patient transfer in 72% of cases and in most patients (94%) the veno-venous configuration was used. ECMO was maintained for a median of 10 days. Outcomes were highly variable among the included studies, with in-hospital or short-term mortality ranging between 8% and 65%, mainly depending on baseline patient features. Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality of 28% (95% confidence interval 18% to 37%; I² = 64%). CONCLUSIONS: ECMO is feasible and effective in patients with ALI due to H1N1 infection. Despite this, prolonged support (more than one week) is required in most cases, and subjects with severe comorbidities or multiorgan failure remain at high risk of in-hospital death.			2013				3241
Effects of Integrated Delivery System on Cost and Quality		Hwang, W., Chang, J., Laclair, M. and Paz, H.				the american journal of managed care	the american journal of managed care	Objectives: To perform a systematic review of the current literature to assess the association between integrated healthcare delivery systems and changes in cost and quality. Methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Reviews, Academic Search Premier, and reference lists were used to retrieve peer-reviewed articles reporting outcomes (cost and quality) related to integrated delivery systems. A general Internet search and reference lists were used to retrieve non-peer reviewed publications meeting the same criteria. Included peer and non-peer reviewed publications were based in the United States and were published between the years 2000 and 2011. Results: A total of 21 peer-reviewed articles and 4 non-peer reviewed manuscripts met the inclusion criteria. Twenty studies showed an association between increased integration in healthcare delivery and an increase in the quality of care. One study reported no changes in quality indicators associated with increased integration. None of these studies measured cost reduction directly, but used reduction in utilization of services instead. Four studies associated decreases in the utilization of services with increases in integration. Conclusions: The vast majority of studies we reviewed have shown that integrated delivery systems have positive effects on quality of care. Few studies linked use of an integrated delivery system to lower health service utilization. Only 1 study reported some small cost savings.			2013				3896
Facilitating early recovery of bowel motility after colorectal surgery: a systematic review		Wallström, A. and Frisman, G. H.				journal of clinical nursing	journal of clinical nursing	Aims and objectives To determine how restored gastrointestinal motility can be accelerated after colorectal surgery. Background Regaining normal bowel functions after surgery is described as unexpectedly problematic. Postoperative ileus is expected after all surgery where the peritoneum is entered, and the length of surgery has little or no impact in terms of the duration of Postoperative ileus. There is some speculation about the best way to facilitate bowel motility after colorectal surgery. Design A systematic review. Method The computerised databases Medline, Scopus and CINAHL were searched to locate randomised, controlled trials by using the following keywords: colorectal surgery, postoperative ileus, recovery of function and gastrointestinal motility. The systematic search was limited to studies published between January 2002-January 2012. Reference lists were also searched manually. Results A total of 34 randomised, controlled trials were included in the review. Recovery of gastrointestinal motility was accelerated when one of the following forms of treatment was administered: probiotics, early feeding in combination with multimodal regimens, pentoxifylline, flurbiprofen, valdecoxib, ketorolac, clonidine, ropivacaine, lidocaine or spinal analgesia. Gum chewing, preoperative carbohydrate loading, bisacodyl and Doppler-guided fluid management have an uncertain effect on bowel motility. The use of nonpharmacological interventions, intrathecal morphine, restricted fluid therapy and choline citrate yielded no significant acceleration in bowel motility. Conclusions A multimodal treatment, where the use of morphine is restricted, seems to be the best way to accelerate the recovery of gastrointestinal bowel motility. However, more studies are required to optimise the multimodal protocol. Relevance to clinical practice The early return of bowel functions leads to quicker overall postoperative recovery, which may ease patient discomfort and decrease hospitalisation costs.			2014				2806
Expanding Paramedic Scope of Practice in the Community: A Systematic Review of the Literature		Bigham, B. L., Kennedy, S. M., Drennan, I. and Morrison, L. J.				prehospital emergency care : official journal of the national association of ems physicians and the national association of state ems directors	prehospital emergency care : official journal of the national association of ems physicians and the national association of state ems directors	Background. Paramedics are an important health human resource and are uniquely mobile in most communities across Canada. In the last dozen years, challenges in the delivery of health care have prompted governments from around the globe to consider expanding the role paramedics play in health systems. Utilizing paramedics for the management of urgent, low-acuity illnesses and injuries has been coined 'community paramedicine,' but the role, safety, and effectiveness of this concept are poorly understood. Objective. We undertook a systematic review of the international literature to describe existing community paramedic programs. Method. We used the Cochrane methodology for systematic reviews. An international group of experts developed a search strategy and a health information specialist executed this search in Medline, Embase, and CINAHL starting January 1, 2000. We included all research articles in the English language that reported a research methodology. We excluded commentaries and letters to the editor. Two investigators independently screened citations in a hierarchical manner and abstracted data. Results. Of 3,089 titles, 10 articles were included in the systematic review and one additional paper was author-nominated. The nature of the 11 articles was heterogeneous, and only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) was found. This trial showed community paramedicine to be beneficial to patients and health systems. The other articles drew conclusions favoring community paramedicine. Conclusion. Community paramedicine research to date is lacking, but programs in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada are perceived to be promising, and one RCT shows that paramedics can safely practice with an expanded scope and improve system performance and patient outcomes. Further research is required to fully understand how expanding paramedic roles affect patients, communities, and health systems.

Ginger ( Zingiber officinale) and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: a systematic literature review		Marx, W. M., Teleni, L., McCarthy, A. L., Vitetta, L., McKavanagh, D., Thomson, D. and Isenring, E.				nutrition reviews	nutrition reviews	Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a common side-effect of cytotoxic treatment. It continues to affect a significant proportion of patients despite the widespread use of antiemetic medication. In traditional medicine, ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used to prevent and treat nausea in many cultures for thousands of years. However, its use has not been confirmed in the chemotherapy context. To determine the potential use of ginger as a prophylactic or treatment for CINV, a systematic literature review was conducted. Reviewed studies comprised randomized controlled trials or crossover trials that investigated the anti-CINV effect of ginger as the sole independent variable in chemotherapy patients. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies were assessed on methodological quality and their limitations were identified. Studies were mixed in their support of ginger as an anti-CINV treatment in patients receiving chemotherapy, with three demonstrating a positive effect, two in favor but with caveats, and two showing no effect on measures of CINV. Future studies are required to address the limitations identified before clinical use can be recommended.			2013				2919
A patient-level meta-analysis of studies evaluating vagus nerve stimulation therapy for treatment-resistant depression		Berry, S. M., Broglio, K., Bunker, M., Jayewardene, A., Olin, B. and Rush, A. J.				medical devices (auckland, n.z.)	medical devices (auckland, n.z.)	OBJECTIVE: To compare response and remission rates in depressed patients with chronic treatment-resistant depression (TRD) treated with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) Therapy(®) plus treatment as usual (VNS + TAU) or TAU alone in a meta-analysis using Bayesian hierarchical models. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Six outpatient, multicenter, clinical trials that have evaluated VNS + TAU or TAU in TRD, including two single-arm studies of VNS + TAU (n = 60 and n = 74), a randomized study of VNS + TAU versus TAU (n = 235), a randomized study of VNS + TAU comparing different VNS stimulation intensities (n = 331), a nonrandomized registry of VNS + TAU versus TAU (n = 636), and a single-arm study of TAU (n = 124) to provide longer-term, control data for comparison with VNS-treated patients. DATA EXTRACTION: A systematic review of individual patient-level data based on the intent-to-treat principle, including all patients who contributed more than one post-baseline visit. Response was based on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Clinical Global Impressions scale's Improvement subscale (CGI-I), as these were the two clinician-rated measures common across all or most studies. Remission was based on the MADRS. RESULTS: Outcomes were compared from baseline up to 96 weeks of treatment with VNS + TAU (n = 1035) versus TAU (n = 425). The MADRS response rate for VNS + TAU at 12, 24, 48, and 96 weeks were 12%, 18%, 28%, and 32% versus 4%, 7%, 12%, and 14% for TAU. The MADRS remission rate for VNS + TAU at 12, 24, 48, and 96 weeks were 3%, 5%, 10%, and 14% versus 1%, 1%, 2%, and 4%, for TAU. Adjunctive VNS Therapy was associated with a greater likelihood of response (odds ratio [OR] = 3.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.12, 4.66) and remission (OR = 4.99, CI: 2.93, 7.76), compared with TAU. For patients who had responded to VNS + TAU at 24 weeks, sustained response was more likely at 48 weeks (OR = 1.98, CI: 1.34, 3.01) and at 96 weeks (OR = 3.42, CI: 1.78, 7.31). Similar results were observed for CGI-I response. CONCLUSION: For patients with chronic TRD, VNS + TAU has greater response and remission rates that are more likely to persist than TAU.			2013				4079
Nonoperative treatment in lumbar spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis: a systematic review		Garet, M., Reiman, M. P., Mathers, J. and Sylvain, J.				sports health	sports health	CONTEXT: Both spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis can be diagnosed across the life span of sports-participating individuals. Determining which treatments are effective for these conditions is imperative to the rehabilitation professional. DATA SOURCES: A computer-assisted literature search was completed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases (1966-April 2012) utilizing keywords related to nonoperative treatment of spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis. Reference lists were also searched to find all relevant articles that fit our inclusion criteria: English language, human, lumbar pain with diagnosed spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis, inclusion of at least 1 nonoperative treatment method, and use of a comparative study design. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were independently extracted from the selected studies by 2 authors and cross-referenced. Any disagreement on relevant data was discussed and resolved by a third author. RESULTS: Ten studies meeting the criteria were rated for quality using the GRADE scale. Four studies found surgical intervention more successful than nonoperative treatment for treating pain and functional limitation. One study found no difference between surgery and nonoperative treatment with regard to future low back pain. Improvement was found in bracing, bracing and exercises emphasizing lumbar extension, range of motion and strengthening exercises focusing on lumbar flexion, and strengthening specific abdominal and lumbar muscles. CONCLUSION: No consensus can be reached on the role of nonoperative versus surgical care because of limited investigation and heterogeneity of studies reported. Studies of nonoperative care options suffered from lack of blinding assessors and control groups and decreased patient compliance with exercise programs.			2013				3306
Exogenous pulmonary surfactant for acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Zhang, L. N., Sun, J. P., Xue, X. Y. and Wang, J. X.				experimental and therapeutic medicine	experimental and therapeutic medicine	Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is often characterized by reduced lung compliance, which suggests dysfunction of the endogenous surfactant system. The effectiveness of exogenous surfactants as replacements for the endogenous system in the treatment of ARDS in adults was assessed. Randomized controlled trials from Medline (1950-2011), Embase (1989-2011), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1994-2011) were analyzed. Two reviewers identified trials for inclusion and the results of included trials were quantitatively pooled with a fixed-effects model. Seven trials (2,144 patients) with good methodological quality were included in the analysis. Pulmonary surfactant treatment was not associated with reduced mortality [relative risk (RR), 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-1.12]. Subgroup analysis revealed no reduced mortality for various surfactant types. Heterogeneity was not significant in the primary outcome analysis (I(2)=0%). There was no evidence of publication bias. Oxygenation, ventilation-free days, duration of ventilation and APACHE II scores did not undergo pooled analysis due to insufficient data. Exogenous surfactant did not reduce mortality in adults with ARDS in our meta-analysis, and we cannot accurately define whether exogenous surfactant has an effect on oxygenation from the included studies.			2013				3371
Untreated obstructive sleep apnea and the risk for serious long-term adverse outcomes: a systematic review		Kendzerska, T., Mollayeva, T., Gershon, A. S., Leung, R. S., Hawker, G. and Tomlinson, G.				sleep medicine reviews	sleep medicine reviews	BACKGROUND: Reports on the association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and risk of death, cardiovascular (CV) events, diabetes and depression have been inconsistent. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the prognostic value of clinical and polysomnographic (PSG) characteristics of OSA for adverse long-term outcomes of untreated OSA in adult patients. A comprehensive search strategy for prognosis studies, OSA, CV events, mortality, depression and diabetes was developed in collaboration with a medical information specialist. All English language studies, from Jan 1999 to Dec 2011, with longitudinal design in adults with OSA diagnosed by PSG recording, found through Medline, Embase and bibliographies of identified articles, were considered eligible. Quality was assessed using published guidelines. RESULTS: Among 26 articles, ten evaluated the association of OSA with mortality, 9 with a composite CV outcome, 4 with stroke, 2 with diabetes and 1 with depression. Significant relationships between the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and outcomes of interest were reported in 18 studies: seven for all-cause mortality, six for composite CV events, three for stroke, one for diabetes and one for depression. The effect of AHI was attenuated by female gender, older age, absence of daytime sleepiness and higher body mass index. Due to clinical heterogeneity between studies, meta-analyses were not performed. CONCLUSION: Evidence exists in men for a relationship between OSA and all-cause mortality and a composite CV outcome. Associations between OSA and other outcomes remain uncertain. Among OSA-specific markers, only AHI was a consistent predictor. Other consistent predictors were traditional CV risk factors. Research is required to identify effect modifiers and the predictive ability of various AHI threshold values and hypopnea definitions. An enhanced set of OSA-specific predictors will allow better risk stratification to guide OSA treatment.			2014				2990
Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery for Pediatric Solid Tumors: A Systematic Review of Feasibility and Current Status		Cundy, T. P., Marcus, H. J., Clark, J., Hughes-Hallett, A., Mayer, E. K., Najmaldin, A. S., Yang, G. Z. and Darzi, A.				european journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of austrian association of pediatric surgery ... [et al] = zeitschrift fur kinderchirurgie	european journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of austrian association of pediatric surgery ... [et al] = zeitschrift fur kinderchirurgie	INTRODUCTION: Open surgery remains the primary technique for resection of pediatric solid tumors despite the popularity of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for oncological indications in adults and nononcological indications in children. Robot-assisted surgery offers technical and ergonomic advantages that might make MIS more achievable in this setting, permitting benefits for both the patient and surgeon. The aim of this study is to critically appraise the current status of robot-assisted MIS for pediatric solid tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of multiple electronic literature databases was undertaken, supplemented by several relevant secondary sources. RESULTS: A total of 23 publications met eligibility criteria, reporting 40 cases overall. Indications for surgery were widely varied, with over 20 different pathologies described. One-third of tumors were classified as malignant. Most procedures involved abdominal or retroperitoneal located tumors in adolescent patients (age range, 1-18 years). The collective complication and conversion rates were 10% and 12.5%, respectively. Oncological adverse events involved two isolated events of tumor spillage and residual disease. The evidence is limited to case reports and small case series only. CONCLUSIONS: For the diverse and highly selective cases in this review, robot-assisted MIS seems safe and feasible. Current status is low volume, in a relatively static state of adoption, and without any apparent index pathology or procedure. The benefits of robot assistance seem well suited but remain unsubstantiated by evidence. Higher quality studies are needed to determine true safety and efficacy.			2014				2923
Effects of Green Tea, Black Tea, and Coffee Consumption on the Risk of Esophageal Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies		Zheng, J. S., Yang, J., Fu, Y. Q., Huang, T., Huang, Y. J. and Li, D.				nutrition and cancer	nutrition and cancer	Epidemiological studies regarding the associations of tea and coffee consumption with esophageal cancer (EC) risk are still inconsistent and this meta-analysis was conducted to examine these associations. PubMed, ISI -Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese VIP database up to October 2011 were searched and manual search for reference lists of relevant studies were conducted. Random effects model was used to pool the odds ratios (OR). Twenty-four case-control and cohort studies with 7376 EC cases were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled OR of EC was 0.77 [95% confidence intervals (95% CI): 0.57, 1.04] for highest vs. non/lowest green tea consumption; but it was statistically significant for case-control studies (OR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.96) and for studies conducted in China (OR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.95). No significant association was observed for the highest vs. non/lowest black tea consumption against EC risk (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 0.86, 2.11). A borderline significantly inverse association of highest vs. non/lowest coffee consumption against EC risk was found (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.01). In conclusion, our data showed that both green tea and coffee consumption, but not black tea consumption, have protective effects on EC.			2013				3639
Intra-articular Corticosteroid Injection in Osteoarthritis of the Knee and Hip: Factors Predicting Pain ReliefA Systematic Review		Hirsch, G., Kitas, G. and Klocke, R.				seminars in arthritis and rheumatism	seminars in arthritis and rheumatism	Objectives: Variations in the degree of pain relief reported by patients with osteoarthritis following intra-articular corticosteroid injections are well recognized but the reasons for this are not widely understood and factors which might predict variations in response have not been subjected to systematic review. We set out to review systematically the literature relating to predictors of pain reduction following intra-articular corticosteroid injections in patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis. Methods: Searches were performed using Medline, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge and MeSH search of Pubmed, the last search being performed in August 2012. Search terms included knee osteoarthritis, hip osteoarthritis, corticosteroid and related terms, and intra-articular injection. Papers were selected and reviewed by 2 reviewers. For inclusion, papers were required to describe studies in which patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip received intra-articular corticosteroid injection as an intervention, contain clearly defined outcome measures relating to pain and contain analysis relating to predictors of clinical response to treatment. Results: Twenty-one studies met criteria for inclusion from a total of 54 papers reviewed in full. Eight of these related to hip OA and 13 related to knee OA. No factors that were investigated as potential predictors of response, including radiographic grade and clinical or sonographic evidence of inflammation or synovial hypertrophy were supported by strong evidence. The review also identified that several plausible potential predictors had not been studied to date. Conclusions: Previous research has not identified reliable predictors of response to IA corticosteroid injections, a widely practised intervention in knee and hip OA. Further studies are required if this question is to be answered.			2013				2850
A systematic review of the effect of red blood cell transfusion on mortality: evidence from large-scale observational studies published between 2006 and 2010		Hopewell, S., Omar, O., Hyde, C., Yu, L. M., Doree, C. and Murphy, M. F.				bmj open	bmj open	OBJECTIVE: To carry out a systematic review of recently published large-scale observational studies assessing the effects of red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) on mortality, with particular emphasis on the statistical methods used to adjust for confounding. Given the limited number of randomised trials of the efficacy of RBCT, clinicians often use evidence from observational studies. However, confounding factors, for example, individuals receiving blood generally being sicker than those who do not, make their interpretation challenging. DESIGN: Systematic review. INFORMATION SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies published from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUDED STUDIES: We included prospective cohort, case-control studies or retrospective analyses of databases or disease registers where the effect of risk factors for mortality or survival was examined. Studies must have included more than 1000 participants receiving RBCT for any cause. We assessed the effects of RBCT versus no RBCT and different volumes and age of RBCT. RESULTS: -32 studies were included in the review; 23 assessed the effects of RBCT versus no RBCT; 5 assessed different volumes and 4 older versus newer RBCT. There was a considerable variability in the patient populations, study designs and level of statistical adjustment. Overall, most studies showed a higher rate of mortality when comparing patients who received RBCT with those who did not, even when these rates were adjusted for confounding; the majority of these increases were statistically significant. The same pattern was observed in studies where protection from bias was likely to be greater, such as prospective studies. CONCLUSIONS: Recent observational studies do show a consistently adverse effect of RBCT on mortality. Whether this is a true effect remains uncertain as it is possible that even the best conducted adjustments cannot completely eliminate the impact of confounding.			2013				3171
Strategies for prevention of postoperative delirium: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials		Zhang, H., Lu, Y., Liu, M., Zou, Z., Wang, L., Xu, F. Y. and Shi, X. Y.				critical care (london, england)	critical care (london, england)	INTRODUCTION: The ideal measures to prevent postoperative delirium remain unestablished. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the significance of potential interventions. METHODS: The PRISMA statement guidelines were followed. Two researchers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library for articles published in English before August 2012. Additional sources included reference lists from reviews and related articles from 'Google Scholar'. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on interventions seeking to prevent postoperative delirium in adult patients were included. Data extraction and methodological quality assessment were performed using predefined data fields and scoring system. Meta-analysis was accomplished for studies that used similar strategies. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of postoperative delirium. We further tested whether interventions effective in preventing postoperative delirium shortened the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: We identified 38 RCTs with interventions ranging from perioperative managements to pharmacological, psychological or multicomponent interventions. Meta-analysis showed dexmedetomidine sedation was associated with less delirium compared to sedation produced by other drugs (two RCTs with 415 patients, pooled risk ratio (RR) = 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.16 to 0.95). Both typical (three RCTs with 965 patients, RR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.54 to 0.93) and atypical antipsychotics (three RCTs with 627 patients, RR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.50) decreased delirium occurrence when compared to placebos. Multicomponent interventions (two RCTs with 325 patients, RR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.86) were effective in preventing delirium. No difference in the incidences of delirium was found between: neuraxial and general anesthesia (four RCTs with 511 patients, RR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.50); epidural and intravenous analgesia (three RCTs with 167 patients, RR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.43) or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and placebo (four RCTs with 242 patients, RR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.63 to 1.44). Effective prevention of postoperative delirium did not shorten the length of hospital stay (10 RCTs with 1,636 patients, pooled SMD (standard mean difference) = -0.06; 95% CI = -0.16 to 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed great inconsistencies in definition, incidence, severity and duration of postoperative delirium. Meta-analysis supported dexmedetomidine sedation, multicomponent interventions and antipsychotics were useful in preventing postoperative delirium.			2013				3037
The effects of most commonly prescribed second generation antidepressants on driving ability: a systematic review : 70th Birthday Prof. Riederer		Brunnauer, A. and Laux, G.				journal of neural transmission (vienna, austria : 1996)	journal of neural transmission (vienna, austria : 1996)	Driving a car is vital for the functional autonomy of patients to take part in activities of daily living. Both psychopathologic symptoms and psychopharmacologic treatment may impair driving ability. This article provides a systematic review of published studies (1980-2011) on commonly prescribed newer antidepressants and driving performance. A total of 21 studies could be included in the review, indicating that there is a lack of controlled patient studies. Investigations on newer antidepressants were frequently undertaken in healthy subjects focusing on acute or subchronic effects of application, predominately in young male participants, with dosages usually given in an ambulatory setting. No data, according to selection criteria, were found with respect to agomelatine, duloxetine, bupropion and viloxazine. There is evidence that the SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine) and the SNRI venlafaxine have no deleterious effects on driving ability. Acute use of mirtazapine does produce impairments that diminish to some degree when given as a nocturnal dose and cannot be seen after repeated dosing in healthy controls. Patients obviously benefit from treatment with newer antidepressants; however, at least a subgroup does not reach performance level of healthy subjects. More patient studies are needed that elaborate specific relationships between clinical subtypes of the illness and response to different antidepressants, considering course and duration of illness, co-morbidities and not least neuropsychological and neurobiological characteristics.			2013				3075
Meta-analysis of selective laser trabeculoplasty with argon laser trabeculoplasty in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma		Wang, H., Cheng, J. W., Wei, R. L., Cai, J. P., Li, Y. and Ma, X. Y.				canadian journal of ophthalmology. journal canadien d'ophtalmologie	canadian journal of ophthalmology. journal canadien d'ophtalmologie	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) and argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Six clinic studies, all of which were random controlled trials. METHODS: Pertinent studies were selected through extensive searches of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and meeting abstracts. Efficacy measures were weighted by mean differences for intraocular pressure (IOP), as well as change of number of glaucoma medications and relative risks (RRs) for therapeutic IOP responses. Tolerability measures were RRs for adverse events. Pooled estimates were carried out in RevMan software 5.1. RESULTS: SLT was associated with a numerically larger reduction compared with ALT, with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.06-1.14). There was no significant difference in therapeutic IOP responses between SLT and ALT, with a pooled RR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.51-1.38). Patients who received SLT took fewer glaucoma medications after operations than those who received ALT, with a WMD of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.01-0.56). When compared in patients with previous failed laser treatment (ALT or SLT), SLT was more effective in IOP reduction than ALT with a WMD of 1.48 (95% CI, 0.75-2.21). The frequencies of anterior chamber flare and IOP peak after operation were similar comparing SLT and ALT, with pooled RRs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.74-1.11) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.45-1.82), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SLT was associated with relatively higher efficacy of IOP lowering compared with ALT. SLT results in a larger reduction of number of glaucoma medications versus ALT, and it appeared to be more effective for patients who did not respond adequately to previous laser treatment. The difference in tolerability of the 2 lasers was not significant.			2013				4007
Metabolic surgery, weight regain and diabetes re-emergence		Campos, J. M., Lins, D. C., Silva, L. B., Araujo-Junior, J. G., Zeve, J. L. and Ferraz Á, A.				arquivos brasileiros de cirurgia digestiva : abcd = brazilian archives of digestive surgery	arquivos brasileiros de cirurgia digestiva : abcd = brazilian archives of digestive surgery	INTRODUCTION: The poor success of clinical treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM2) increased interest in metabolic surgery, which has been considered a promising alternative for the control of obese or non-obese diabetics. However, there is still no long-term follow-up to evaluate the duration of diabetes remission, and if weight regain would be associated to recurrence. AIM: 1) To describe the results of diabetic patients with a BMI < 30 and < 35 kg/m² submitted to the following types of metabolic surgery: ileal interposition and sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), adjustable gastric banding, duodeno-jejunal exclusion and duodeno-jejunal bypass; 2) to evaluate the possible relapse of diabetes after occurrence of weight regain on long-term after bariatric surgery. METHOD: An expositive and historical literature review about metabolic surgery in diabetic patients with BMI < 30 and < 35 kg/m² was conducted, and systematic review of the association between disease relapse and weight regain after bariatric surgery. RESULTS: After analysis of 188 published papers on Medline until 2010, three papers were selected, which included 269 patients who underwent RYGB. Pre-operatory BMI was between 37 and 60 kg/m² and follow-up of three to 16 years. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Two studies showed association between weight regain and recurrence of type 2 diabetes, while the third did not show this association when comparing groups with and without weight regain; 2) metabolic surgery has shown adequate control of T2DM2 in class I obese subjects; however, the non-obese group still need a long-term evaluation, considering the risk of diabetes recurrence when after weight regain.			2013				3764
Rheumatoid factor and response to TNF antagonists in rheumatoid arthritis: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies		Salgado, E., Maneiro, J. R., Carmona, L. and Gómez-Reino, J.				joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme	joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme	OBJECTIVE: To systematically analyze literature with the aim of examining whether rheumatoid factor (RF) is a predictor of response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies were conducted. All studies on the association of baseline RF (titer and/or status) and response to any TNF antagonists, or with enough information to estimate this association were included. Qualitative analysis and meta-analysis using random-effects approach by type of outcome response and RF test was performed. Risk of publication bias was also evaluated. RESULTS: The systematic review included 18 studies of 4163 identified articles, involving 5703 patients with homogeneous baseline characteristics. The most common outcome to assess response was European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria, normally merging good and moderate categories as response. The weighted mean difference (WMD) of baseline IgM RF titer in meta-analysis was higher in the non-responders group [-101.58 (95% CI -156.58,-46.59) I2=0.0]. Combined odds ratios (ORs) of positive IgM RF, positive IgA RF, and positive IgG RF to achieve good/moderate response were 1.08 (0.80, 1.47), I2=40.9%; 0.83 (0.39, 1.73), I2=39.8%, and 1.30 (0.48, 3.51), I2=62.9%, respectively. We did not find an association between a positive IgM RF and EULAR good response or remission. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis does not support baseline IgM RF titer as a predictor of response to TNF antagonists in RA. However, this conclusion is hampered by high heterogeneity in the studies included in this meta-analysis.			2014				3067
Is there a role for carboplatin in the treatment of malignant germ cell tumors? A systematic review of adult and pediatric trials		Shaikh, F., Nathan, P. C., Hale, J., Uleryk, E. and Frazier, L.				pediatric blood & cancer	pediatric blood & cancer	BACKGROUND: While cisplatin is considered superior to carboplatin for the treatment of malignant germ cell tumors (MGCTs) in adults, pediatric oncology collaborative groups still remain concerned about the late effects of cisplatin in children. METHODS: We performed a literature search to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that used carboplatin for MGCTs in adults. Since no RCTs were available in children, we identified cohort studies of pediatric MGCTs treated with carboplatin. We compared the adult and pediatric studies in terms of characteristics, doses of chemotherapy, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2,131 publications retrieved, five RCTs in adults (1,340 patients) and four cohort studies in children (219 patients) met criteria for inclusion. All adult RCTs evaluated carboplatin versus cisplatin regimens in men with good-prognosis metastatic MGCTs. Carboplatin regimens had a higher risk of events (RR 2.51, P < 0.001) and of deaths (RR 2.21, P < 0.001) than cisplatin regimens. Across all five RCTs, 497/654 (76%) of adults who received carboplatin remained event-free. Compared to the adult trials, three pediatric studies used carboplatin at a higher dose, frequency, and number of cycles. Across these three studies, 158/179 (88%) of children remained event-free. CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin is superior to carboplatin at the studied doses for the treatment of adult metastatic MGCTs. However, we observe that carboplatin is associated with good outcomes for children with MGCT when used at the higher doses. We hypothesize that a risk-adapted approach utilizing both platinum agents may achieve the optimal balance between cure and late effects.			2013				3656
Prophylaxis with antipsychotic medication reduces the risk of post-operative delirium in elderly patients: a meta-analysis		Teslyar, P., Stock, V. M., Wilk, C. M., Camsari, U., Ehrenreich, M. J. and Himelhoch, S.				psychosomatics	psychosomatics	"BACKGROUND: Delirium commonly occurs in hospitalized elderly patients, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Although evidence for treatment of delirium exists, evidence supporting pharmacologic prevention of delirium in high risk patients is limited. OBJECTIVE: This review examined whether delirium in at-risk patients can be prevented with antipsychotic prophylaxis in the inpatient setting. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature review of articles from January 1950 to April 2012 was conducted in PubMed, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Controlled Trials and databases. STUDY SELECTION: Five studies (1491 participants) met our inclusion criteria for analysis. Medication administered included haloperidol (three studies), risperidone (one study), and olanzapine (1 study). All five studies examined older post-surgical patients, spanning five different countries. DATA EXTRACTION: Only RCTs of antipsychotic medication used to prevent delirium were included. Key words used in the search were: ""delirium,"" ""encephalopathy,"" ""ICU psychosis,"" ""prevention,"" and ""prophylaxis."" Studies had to include a validated method of diagnosing delirium. Data analysis was performed using the Metan command in Stata (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX). RESULTS: The pooled relative risk of the five studies resulted in a 50% reduction in the relative risk of delirium among those receiving antipsychotic medication compared with placebo (RR(95% CI): 0.51 (0.33-0.79; heterogeneity, p < 0.01, random effects model). Examination of the funnel plot did not indicate publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Although few studies have examined prophylactic use of antipsychotics, this analysis suggests that perioperative use of prophylactic antipsychotics may effectively reduce the overall risk of postoperative delirium in elderly patients."			2013				3778
Qualitative evidence from a systematic review of prognostic predictors for surgical outcomes following cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament		Xing, D., Wang, J., Ma, J. X., Chen, Y., Yang, Y., Zhu, S. W. and Ma, X. L.				journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the neurosurgical society of australasia	journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the neurosurgical society of australasia	Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a pathological ectopic ossification of this ligament that usually occurs in the cervical spine. For patients with cervical OPLL and neurological symptoms, surgical intervention is necessary but not always effective. Various prognostic factors influence the surgical outcome. The results of studies identifying these prognostic predictors are often inconclusive or contradictory. These predictors have not been well identified or summarized. The present study was designed to identify the prognostic predictors for the surgical outcome of cervical OPLL based on the available evidence in the literature. Non-interventional studies were searched in Medline, Embase, Science Direct, OVID and the Cochrane library. Forty-two observational studies involving 2791 patients were included. The quality of the included studies was assessed with a modified quality assessment tool, which was originally designed for use with observational studies. The effects of the studies were combined with the study quality score using a model of best-evidence synthesis. There was strong evidence for five predictors: (i) age, (ii) duration of symptoms, (iii) pre-operative neurological score, (iv) transverse area of the spinal cord, and (v) intramedullary high signal intensity on the T2-weighted MRI. We also identified eight predictors with moderate supporting evidence, seven with limited evidence, four with conflicting evidence and four predictors without supporting evidence. While there is no conclusive evidence regarding the surgical outcomes following cervical OPLL, these data provide evidence to guide the clinician in choosing an optimal therapeutic strategy for patients with cervical OPLL. Further research is necessary to fully evaluate the effects of the predictors described in this study.			2013				3534
Pemetrexed in head and neck cancer: a systematic review		Argiris, A., Pennella, E., Koustenis, A., Hossain, A. M. and Obasaju, C. K.				oral oncology	oral oncology	"Pemetrexed has been evaluated as a novel chemotherapeutic for head and neck cancer (HNC). In this review, we examined the efficacy and tolerability of pemetrexed in patients with HNC. Relevant English-language literature was identified via PubMed and a review of published abstracts from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Society for Medical Oncology annual meetings from January 2000 through September 2012. Search terms were ""pemetrexed"" (or ""LY231514"") and ""head and neck cancer."" Completed prospective phase I to III trials of pemetrexed alone or in combination with other agents or radiotherapy evaluating objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and/or overall survival (OS) were eligible; ten studies were reviewed. Results for ORR, PFS, and/or OS in patients receiving pemetrexed in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents and/or radiotherapy were promising in the first-line treatment setting. Pemetrexed was associated with acceptable grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities; it did not result in nonhematologic toxicities commonly seen with cisplatin, such as nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neuropathy. In a single phase III randomized trial, although median OS was longer for patients treated with pemetrexed plus cisplatin (7.3 months) versus cisplatin plus placebo (6.3 months), the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=.082). Results of this review suggest that pemetrexed is an active chemotherapeutic in combination with other agents or radiotherapy in patients with HNC. In particular, the role of pemetrexed as a radiosensitizer and potential alternative to cisplatin warrants investigation. More research is needed to clearly define the role of pemetrexed in HNC treatment."			2013				3309
Evidence of Physiotherapy Interventions for Patients with Chronic Neck Pain: A Systematic Review of Randomised Controlled Trials		Damgaard, P., Bartels, E. M., Ris, I., Christensen, R. and Juul-Kristensen, B.				isrn pain	isrn pain	Chronic neck pain (CNP) is common and costly, and the effect of physiotherapeutic interventions on the condition is unclear. We reviewed the literature for evidence of effect of physiotherapy interventions on patients with CNP. Five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PEDro) were systematically searched. Randomised, placebo and active-treatment-controlled trials including physiotherapy interventions for adults with CNP were selected. Data were extracted primary outcome was pain. Risk of bias was appraised. Effect of an intervention was assessed, weighted to risk of bias. 42 trials reporting on randomised comparisons of various physiotherapy interventions and control conditions were eligible for inclusion involving 3919 patients with CNP. Out of these, 23 were unclear or at high risk of bias, and their results were considered moderate- or low-quality evidence. Nineteen were at low risk of bias, and here eight trials found effect on pain of a physiotherapy intervention. Only exercise therapy, focusing on strength and endurance training, and multimodal physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural interventions, massage, manipulations, laser therapy, and to some extent also TNS appear to have an effect on CNP. However, sufficient evidence for application of a specific physiotherapy modality or aiming at a specific patient subgroup is not available.			2013				3536
Treatment of Prostate Cancer With Intermittent Versus Continuous Androgen Deprivation: A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials		Niraula, S., Le, L. W. and Tannock, I. F.				journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the american society of clinical oncology	journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the american society of clinical oncology	PURPOSE: Uncertainty exists regarding benefits of intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) compared with continuous androgen deprivation (CAD) for treatment of prostate cancer. On the basis of a systematic review of evidence, our aim was to formulate a recommendation for either IAD or CAD to treat relapsing, locally advanced, or metastatic prostate cancer. METHODS: We searched literature published up to September 2012 from MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and major conference proceedings. We included randomized controlled trials comparing IAD and CAD if they reported overall survival (OS) or biochemical/radiologic time to disease progression.RESULTS: Nine studies with 5,508 patients met our criteria. There were no significant differences in time-to-event outcomes between the groups in any studies. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.11) for IAD compared with CAD, and the HR for progression-free survival was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.20). More prostate cancer-related deaths with IAD tended to be balanced by more deaths not related to prostate cancer with CAD. Superiority of IAD for sexual function, physical activity, and general well-being was observed in some trials. Median cost savings with IAD was estimated to be 48%. CONCLUSION: There is fair evidence to recommend use of IAD instead of CAD for the treatment of men with relapsing, locally advanced, or metastatic prostate cancer who achieve a good initial response to androgen deprivation. This recommendation is based on evidence against superiority of either strategy for time-to-event outcomes and substantial decrease with IAD in exposure to androgen deprivation, resulting in less cost, inconvenience, and potential toxicity.			2013				2996
N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to prevent atrial fibrillation: updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials		Mariani, J., Doval, H. C., Nul, D., Varini, S., Grancelli, H., Ferrante, D., Tognoni, G. and Macchia, A.				journal of the american heart association	journal of the american heart association	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have antiarrhythmic effects on atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to assess the effects of therapy with n-3 PUFAs on the incidence of recurrent AF and on postoperative AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic searches were conducted in Web of Science, Medline, Biological Abstracts, Journal Citation Reports, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. In addition, data from the recently completed FOR?ARD and OPERA trials were included. We included randomized controlled trials comparing treatment with n-3 PUFAs versus control to (1) prevent recurrent AF in patients who underwent reversion of AF or (2) prevent incident postoperative AF after cardiac surgery. Of identified studies, 12.9% (16 of 124) were included, providing data on 4677 patients. Eight studies (1990 patients) evaluated n-3 PUFA effects on AF recurrence among patients with reverted AF and 8 trials (2687 patients) on postoperative AF. Pooled risk ratios through random-effects models showed no significant effects on AF recurrence (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.13; I(2), 72%) or on postoperative AF (0.86; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.04; I(2), 53.1%). A funnel plot suggested publication bias among postoperative trials but not among persistent AF trials. Meta-regression analysis did not find any relationship between doses and effects (P=0.887 and 0.833 for recurrent and postoperative AF, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Published clinical trials do not support n-3 PUFAs as agents aimed at preventing either postoperative or recurrent AF.

A meta-analytic review of the effect of implementation intentions on physical activity		Bélanger-Gravel, A., Godin, G. and Amireault, S.				health psychology review	health psychology review	Implementation intentions are a powerful strategy to promote health-related behaviours, but mixed results are observed regarding physical activity. The primary aim of this study was to systematically and quantitatively review the literature on the effectiveness of implementation intentions on physical activity. The second aim was to identify conditions under which effectiveness is optimal. A literature search was performed in several databases for published and non-published reports. The inverse variance method with random effect model was used for the meta-analysis of results. Effect sizes were reported as standard mean differences. Twenty-six independent studies were included in the systematic review. The overall effect size of implementation intentions was 0.31, 95% confidence intervals (CI) [0.11, 0.51] at post-intervention and 0.24, 95% CI [0.13, 0.35] at follow-up. The duration of follow-up had no significant effect on effect size (F(1, 18) = 0.21, p=0.66. This strategy was more effective among student and clinical samples, and when barrier management was part of implementation intentions. The present meta-analysis provides support for the use of implementation intentions to promote physical activity, even though the effect size is small to medium.			2013				3773
Macrolides vs. quinolones for community-acquired pneumonia: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials		Skalsky, K., Yahav, D., Lador, A., Eliakim-Raz, N., Leibovici, L. and Paul, M.				clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the european society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases	clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the european society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases	The relative efficacy, safety and ecological implications of macrolides vs. quinolones in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are debatable. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing any macrolide vs. any quinolone for the treatment of CAP among adult inpatients or outpatients, as monotherapy or both in combination with a beta-lactam. We did not limit inclusion by pneumonia severity, publication status, language or date of publication. The primary outcomes assessed were 30-day all-cause mortality and treatment failure. Two authors independently extracted the data. Fixed effect meta-analysis of risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals was performed. Sixteen trials (4989 patients) fulfilling inclusion criteria were identified, mostly assessing outpatients with mild to moderate CAP. All-cause mortality was not significantly different for macrolides vs. quinolones, RR 1.03 (0.63-1.68, seven trials), with a low event rate (2%). Treatment failure was significantly lower with quinolones, RR 0.78 (0.67-0.91, 16 trials). The definition of failure used in the primary studies was not clearly representative of patients' benefit. Microbiological failure was lower with quinolones, RR 0.63 (0.49-0.81, 13 trials). All adverse events, adverse events requiring discontinuation and any premature antibiotic discontinuation were significantly more frequent with macrolides, mainly on account of gastrointestinal adverse events. Resistance development was not assessed in the trials. Randomized controlled trials show an advantage of quinolones in the treatment of CAP with regard to clinical cure without need for antibiotic modification at end of treatment and gastrointestinal adverse events. The clinical significance of this advantage is unclear.			2013				4001
[Cerebrolysin for acute ischemic stroke]		iganshina, L. E. and Abakumova, T. R.				vestnik rossi?sko? akademii meditsinskikh nauk / rossi?skaia akademiia meditsinskikh nauk	vestnik rossi?sko? akademii meditsinskikh nauk / rossi?skaia akademiia meditsinskikh nauk	The review discusses existing evidence of benefits and risks of cerebrolysin--a mixture of low-molecular-weight peptides and amino acids derived from pigs' brain tissue with proposed neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties, for acute ischemic stroke. The review presents results of systematic search and analysis of randomised clinical trials comparing cerebrolysin with placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Only one trial was selected as meeting quality criteria. No difference in death and adverse events between cerebrolysin and placebo was established. The authors conclude about insufficiency of evidence to evaluate the effect of cerebrolysin on survival and dependency in people with acute ischemic stroke.			2013				3670
[Meta analysis of the efficacy and safety of combined treatment with ARB and ACEI on diabetic kidney disease]		Gu, J., Han, L. and Liu, Q.				???????????(journal of central south university. medical sciences)	???????????(journal of central south university. medical sciences)	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined treatment with angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) on diabetic kidney disease. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from CoChrane library, PubMed, EMbase, CNKI and VIP. Eleven RCTs involving 602 patients were included and analyzed with Rev Man 5.1 software. RESULTS: Compared with ACEI alone, combined treatment with ARB and ACEI was more effective on decreasing 24 h albuminuria, systolic pressure, average 24 h systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and average 24 h diastolic pressure but with a high level of serum potassium. Compared with ARB alone, combined treatment with ARB and ACEI was more effective on decreasing systolic pressure and diastolic pressure. Compared with ACEI or ARB alone, we didn't get a definite conclusion that whether combined treatment with ARB and ACEI was more effective on decreasing 24 h proteinuria. CONCLUSION: Based on this Meta analysis, combined treatment with ARB and ACEI is safer and has positive effect on diabetic kidney disease. However, small sample size and low methodological quality appeared in most of the trials included in this systematic review. Therefore, available evidence is insufficient to recommend a routine clinical application of combined treatment with ARB and ACEI on diabetic kidney disease.			2013				3876
Safety profile of protein kinase inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis: systematic review and meta-analysis		Salgado, E., Maneiro, J. R., Carmona, L. and Gomez-Reino, J. J.				annals of the rheumatic diseases	annals of the rheumatic diseases	OBJECTIVE: To summarise the adverse events (AE) reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with protein kinase inhibitors (PKi), and identify family and molecule-related AEs. METHODS: Systematic review of the PKi used in clinical trials (CTs) in RA. Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge, and international abstracts of congress were reviewed, (up to 31 October 2012). Search was limited to interventional studies of PKi used in CTs in RA, written in English, and reporting frequencies of AE. Diseases with similar comorbidity burden also were included. Frequency of AE, serious AE (SAE), death and discontinuation due to  AEs (DCAE) were recorded. Risk of bias was assessed. Meta-analysis was carried using pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% CI as effect measure. RESULTS: The search produced 4410 hits. Forty-one articles reporting data on 21 PKi of the Janus kinase (JAK), SYK, p38 and cKit families were selected for detailed analysis. In patients treated with p38 inhibitors, RR for dizziness was 2.36 (1.20 to 4.63), and in patients treated with c-Kit inhibitors, RR for oedema was 3.43 (1.58 to 7.42). In patients treated with the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, RR for hypercholesterolaemia was 1.70 (1.10 to 2.63) that was dose related. In patients treated with the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib, pooled RR for hypertransaminasaemia, hypertension, diarrhoea and neutropenia were 2.93 (1.02 to 8.43), 2.80 (1.58 to 5.99), 5.20 (3.19 to 8.49) and 9.24 (2.22 to 38.42), respectively. Serious infections and malignancies were not significantly more frequent in PKi-treated patients than in comparator groups. CONCLUSIONS: Event rates of serious infections and malignancies with PKi are not different from biologics. In addition, PKi have a unique safety profile related to target and off-target inhibition of kinases, at times dose related.			2014				3011
Review of the application of positive psychology to substance use, addiction, and recovery research		Krentzman, A. R.				psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the society of psychologists in addictive behaviors	psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the society of psychologists in addictive behaviors	Advances in positive psychology have grown exponentially over the past decade. The addictions field has experienced its own growth in a positive direction, embodied by the recovery movement. Despite parallel developments, and great momentum on both sides, there has been little crosspollination. This article introduces positive psychology and the recovery movement, describes the research on positive psychology in the addictions, and discusses future avenues of theory, research, and intervention based on a positive-psychology framework. A systematic review of positive psychology applied to substance use, addiction, and recovery found nine studies which are discussed according to the following themes: theoretical propositions, character strengths and drinking, positive psychology and recovery, positive interventions, and addiction: feeling good and feeling bad. The current scholarship is scant, but diverse, covering a wide range of populations (adults, adolescents, those in and out of treatment), topics (character strengths, recovery, positive affect), and addictive behaviors (work addiction, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use disorders). There is diversity, too, in country of origin, with work originating in the U.S., U.K., Poland, and Spain. The rigorous application of the lens, tools, and approaches of positive psychology to addiction research generally, and to the aims of the recovery movement specifically, has potential for the development of theory and innovation in prevention and intervention. Further, because the work in positive psychology has primarily focused on microsystems, it may be primed to make contributions to the predominantly macrosystems focus of the recovery movement.

Scalp acupuncture for Parkinson's disease: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials		Lee, H. S., Park, H. L., Lee, S. J., Shin, B. C., Choi, J. Y. and Lee, M. S.				chinese journal of integrative medicine	chinese journal of integrative medicine	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of scalp acupuncture (SA), a modern acupuncture technique specialized to neurological disorders, in managing motor function and symptoms for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. METHODS: Two independent reviewers extracted data from all of the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy of SA for PD compared with conventional therapies (CTs). Sixteen electronic databases were searched. The risk of bias was appraised with the Cochrane Collaboration tool, and the reporting of the included studies was evaluated by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 checklist and the revised Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) guidelines. RESULTS: In total, 4 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. As assessed by the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), 2 RCTs showed that SA combined with CTs proved superior to CTs alone [60 cases; weighted mean difference, -3.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), -6.05 to -1.84, P=0.01; I(2) =0%]. Based on the Webster scale, however, 3 RCTs showed no superior effect of SA when combined with CTs with high heterogeneity (154 cases; risk ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.79 to 2.12, P=0.30; I(2) =84%). The Cochrane risk of bias, adherence to the CONSORT and the STRICTA checklist showed that the quality of all the included RCTs was generally low. CONCLUSIONS: The result of our systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that the effectiveness of SA for PD is promising, however, the evidence is not convincing. A sham-controlled RCT design that adheres to the CONSORT and STRICTA guidelines to overcome methodological weakness and that includes a large sample size is strongly recommended to confirm the precise effect of SA on PD.			2013				3027
Fulvestrant for advanced breast cancer: a meta-analysis		Al-Mubarak, M., Sacher, A. G., Ocana, A., Vera-Badillo, F., Seruga, B. and Amir, E.				cancer treatment reviews	cancer treatment reviews	BACKGROUND: Fulvestrant is an endocrine agent which degrades the estrogen receptor, thereby downregulating its signaling. Trials of fulvestrant are limited by inconsistent study populations and drug dosing. The optimal use of fulvestrant in advanced breast cancer is therefore unclear. METHODS: A systematic review of electronic databases was conducted to identify randomized trials of fulvestrant versus other endocrine therapy. The hazard ratios (HR) for time to progression (TTP) and the odds ratios (OR) for serious adverse events (SAEs), discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity and commonly reported toxicities (hot flashes, venous thrombosis, gastrointestinal disturbance, arthralgia, and asthenia) were pooled in a meta-analysis. Meta-regression explored heterogeneity in study population and fulvestrant dosing. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in the analysis. Overall, there was no difference in TTP between fulvestrant and control groups (HR: 0.94, p=0.18). On meta-regression, fulvestrant showed reduced hazards for TTP compared to aromatase inhibitors (AI) if used in first line, in studies where fewer patients received adjuvant endocrine therapy and at higher doses. Rates of SAEs and treatment discontinuation were similar for fulvestrant and control groups, but fulvestrant monotherapy was associated with significantly less arthralgia (OR: 0.73, p=0.02). The addition of fulvestrant to AI was not associated with improved TTP, but led to increased toxicity. CONCLUSION: In unselected patients, fulvestrant monotherapy is associated with similar efficacy, but reduced arthralgia compared with other endocrine therapy options. Use of high dose fulvestrant monotherapy in first line or in patients with limited prior exposure to adjuvant endocrine therapy may delay progression compared with AI.			2013				4028
Relationship of symptom duration and fecal bacteriotherapy in Clostridium difficile infection-pooled data analysis and a systematic review		Sofi, A. A., Silverman, A. L., Khuder, S., Garborg, K., Westerink, J. M. and Nawras, A.				scandinavian journal of gastroenterology	scandinavian journal of gastroenterology	OBJECTIVE: Clostridium difficle-associated infection (CDI) is usually treated with antibiotics; nevertheless, the infection has a high relapse rate. Case series and case reports using fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for CDI show promising results. However, there are no large studies to provide evidence for the efficacy of this therapy. The aim of this pooled patient data meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of FMT in CDI. METHODS: We performed a literature search for FMT for CDI or pseudomembranous colitis. Individual patient data were obtained from each study. The primary endpoint was to assess the rate of diarrhea resolution. Secondary endpoints were to identify variables associated with treatment failure and side effects of therapy. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients from 25 published articles who received FMT for CDI were included in the pooled data analysis. FMT had an overall success rate of 91.2%. On univariate analysis, shorter duration of symptoms before FMT (< 60 days) and gastroduodenal route of fecal instillation were associated with treatment failure. On multivariate regression analysis, shorter duration of symptoms (< 60 days) before the FMT (OR= 11.08; p = 0.0009) was associated with treatment failure. Reported adverse events following FMT were irritable bowel syndrome (n = 1), symptoms of mild enteritis (n = 3), and suspected peritonitis following the procedure (n = 1). CONCLUSION: FMT is a safe and effective treatment option for CDI. Shorter duration of symptoms (< 60 days) before administering FMT is associated with treatment failure.			2013				3541
Ultrafiltration versus intravenous diuretic therapy to treat acute heart failure: a systematic review		Wen, H., Zhang, Y., Zhu, J., Lan, Y. and Yang, H.				american journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions	american journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions	BACKGROUND: Patients with decompensated heart failure frequently present with volume overload, which is conventionally treated with diuretics. These drugs have been associated with several adverse effects, including increased mortality, leading some clinicians to propose ultrafiltration as a safe alternative to remove sodium and water. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to compare the safety and efficacy of ultrafiltration and conventional intravenous diuretic therapy for patients with acute heart failure and volume overload. DATA SOURCES: We searched the following databases through November 2012: Cochrane Library (1993-), PubMed (1988-), OVID (1984-), EBSCO (1984-), CBM (1978-), VIP (1989-), and CNKI (1979-). In addition, we manually searched relevant references and review articles. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of ultrafiltration and intravenous diuretics in patients diagnosed with hypervolemic acute heart failure were included. Five trials were found to satisfy all the inclusion criteria. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Two reviewers independently determined study eligibility, assessed methodological quality and extracted the data. We analyzed the data and pooled them, when appropriate, using Revman 5.0. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook 5.0 for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, taking into account sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. RESULTS: Data from the initial phase of five trials involving 477 participants were included. Meta-analysis of the pooled data showed that ultrafiltration was significantly better than diuretic drugs based on 48-h weight loss (Z = 3.72; P < 0.001, weighted mean difference [WMD] = 1.25 kg, 95 % CI 0.59-1.91) and based on 48-h fluid removal (Z = 4.23; P < 0.001, WMD = 1.06 L, 95 % CI 0.57-1.56). Adverse events did not differ significantly between the ultrafiltration and intravenous diuretic treatment groups. LIMITATIONS: There are several limitations to our review, including publication bias and selection bias. Our review included only a few studies involving relatively few participants. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that early ultrafiltration is safe and effective for patients with hypervolemic acute heart failure. It allows greater fluid removal and weight loss by 48 h than do intravenous diuretics, with no significant increase in adverse effects.			2013				2945
Early and intermediate survival after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 studies		Messori, A., Trippoli, S. and Biancari, F.				bmj open	bmj open	BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implants (TAVIs) is indicated as an alternative to surgical valve replacement for patients unfit for surgery. No systematic review has studied survival after 2 years and limited information is available on between-study heterogeneity. OBJECTIVES: A systematic review and meta-analysis on intermediate survival after TAVI. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and references of selected articles. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Clinical studies evaluating TAVI, published between 2010 and 2012, reporting survival at 2 or more years. PARTICIPANTS: About 3500 patients from 14 studies. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Proportion meta-analysis with 95% CI and heterogeneity assessment (I(2) and Cochran's Q). Meta-regression analysis was performed as well. RESULTS: Pooled immediate postoperative death rate was 7.8% (95% CI 6.2% to 9.8%, I(2)=40.8%; Cochran's Q=97.7 with 92.9 df, p<0.0001) and stroke rate was 3.8% (95% CI 2.8% to 5.0%, I(2)=34.3%; Cochran's Q=96.5 with 92.9 df, p<0.0001). Pooled death rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 23.2%, 31.0% and 38.6%, respectively. Among studies reporting on concomitant percutaneous coronary intervention, pooled death rates at 30 days, 1 year and 2 years were 6.3%, 17.8% and 25.8%, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Although our analysis examined a total of about 3500 patients, only a minority of these were actually followed up after 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled survival rates after TAVI (at 2 years: 69.0%; at 3 years: 61.4%) can be considered excellent, particularly in the light of the high-risk profile of this patient population. IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: The favourable intermediate outcome in patients subjected to TAVI seems to justify its use in patients unfit for surgery. Such pooled results indicate that TAVI is a valid alternative to surgical valve replacement, but lack of data on late durability after TAVI prevents its use in low-risk patients with long expectancy of life.			2013				2802
Body weight loss reverts obesity-associated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Corona, G., Rastrelli, G., Monami, M., Saad, F., Luconi, M., Lucchese, M., Facchiano, E., Sforza, A., Forti, G., Mannucci, E. and Maggi, M.				european journal of endocrinology / european federation of endocrine societies	european journal of endocrinology / european federation of endocrine societies	OBJECTIVE: Few randomized clinical studies have evaluated the impact of diet and physical activity on testosterone levels in obese men with conflicting results. Conversely, studies on bariatric surgery in men generally have shown an increase in testosterone levels. The aim of this study is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of available trials on the effect of body weight loss on sex hormones levels. DESIGN: Meta-analysis. METHODS: An extensive Medline search was performed including the following words: 'testosterone', 'diet', 'weight loss', 'bariatric surgery', and 'males'. The search was restricted to data from January 1, 1969 up to August 31, 2012. RESULTS: Out of 266 retrieved articles, 24 were included in the study. Of the latter, 22 evaluated the effect of diet or bariatric surgery, whereas two compared diet and bariatric surgery. Overall, both a low-calorie diet and bariatric surgery are associated with a significant (P<0.0001) increase in plasma sex hormone-binding globulin-bound and -unbound testosterone levels (total testosterone (TT)), with bariatric surgery being more effective in comparison with the low-calorie diet (TT increase: 8.73 (6.51-10.95) vs 2.87 (1.68-4.07) for bariatric surgery and the low-calorie diet, respectively; both P<0.0001 vs baseline). Androgen rise is greater in those patients who lose more weight as well as in younger, non-diabetic subjects with a greater degree of obesity. Body weight loss is also associated with a decrease in estradiol and an increase in gonadotropins levels. Multiple regression analysis shows that the degree of body weight loss is the best determinant of TT rise (B=2.50±0.98, P=0.029). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that weight loss is associated with an increase in both bound and unbound testosterone levels. The normalization of sex hormones induced by body weight loss is a possible mechanism contributing to the beneficial effects of surgery in morbid obesity.			2013				2971
Effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis coupled with contact tracing in reducing the transmission of the influenza A (H1N1-2009): a systematic review		Mizumoto, K., Nishiura, H. and Yamamoto, T.				theoretical biology & medical modelling	theoretical biology & medical modelling	BACKGROUND: During the very early stage of the 2009 pandemic, mass chemoprophylaxis was implemented as part of containment measure. The purposes of the present study were to systematically review the retrospective studies that investigated the effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis during the 2009 pandemic, and to explicitly estimate the effectiveness by employing a mathematical model. METHODS: A systematic review identified 17 articles that clearly defined the cases and identified exposed individuals based on contact tracing. Analysing a specific school-driven outbreak, we estimated the effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis using a renewal equation model. Other parameters, including the reproduction number and the effectiveness of antiviral treatment and school closure, were jointly estimated. RESULTS: Based on the systematic review, median secondary infection risks (SIRs) among exposed individuals with and without prophylaxis were estimated at 2.1% (quartile: 0, 12.2) and 16.6% (quartile: 8.4, 32.4), respectively. A very high heterogeneity in the SIR was identified with an estimated I2 statistic at 71.8%. From the outbreak data in Madagascar, the effectiveness of mass chemoprophylaxis in reducing secondary transmissions was estimated to range from 92.8% to 95.4% according to different model assumptions and likelihood functions, not varying substantially as compared to other parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Only based on the meta-analysis of retrospective studies with different study designs and exposure settings, it was not feasible to estimate the effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis in reducing transmission. However, modelling analysis of a single outbreak successfully yielded an estimate of the effectiveness that appeared to be robust to model assumptions. Future studies should fill the data gap that has existed in observational studies and allow mathematical models to be used for the analysis of meta-data.			2013				3029
Systematic review and comparison of pharmacologic therapies for neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury		Snedecor, S. J., Sudharshan, L., Cappelleri, J. C., Sadosky, A., Desai, P., Jalundhwala, Y. J. and Botteman, M.				journal of pain research	journal of pain research	BACKGROUND: Management of neuropathic pain (NeP) associated with spinal cord injury (SCI) is difficult. This report presents a systematic literature review and comparison of the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for treating SCI-associated NeP. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were searched through December 2011 for randomized, blinded, and controlled clinical trials of SCI-associated NeP meeting predefined inclusion criteria. Efficacy outcomes of interest were pain reduction on the 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) or 100 mm visual analog scale and proportion of patients achieving ?30% or ?50% pain reduction. Discontinuations and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed, for which Bayesian meta-analytic indirect comparisons were performed. RESULTS: Of the nine studies included in the analysis, samples were <100 patients, except for one pregabalin study (n = 136). Standard errors for the NRS outcome were often not reported, precluding quantitative comparisons across treatments. Estimated 11-point NRS pain reduction relative to placebo was -1.72 for pregabalin, -1.65 for amitriptyline, -1.0 for duloxetine, -1 (median) for levetiracetam, -0.27 for gabapentin, 1 (median) for lamotrigine, and 2 for dronabinol. Risk ratios relative to placebo for 30% improvement were 0.71 for levetiracetam and 2.56 for pregabalin, and 0.94 and 2.91, respectively, for 50% improvement. Meta-analytic comparisons showed significantly more AEs with pregabalin and tramadol compared with placebo, and no differences between placebo and any treatment for discontinuations. CONCLUSIONS: Studies of SCI-associated NeP were few, small, and reported insufficient data for quantitative comparisons of efficacy. However, available data suggested pregabalin was associated with more favorable efficacy for all outcome measures examined, and that the risks of AEs and discontinuations were found to be similar among the therapies.			2013				3025
Alternative lipid emulsions in the critically ill: a systematic review of the evidence		Manzanares, W., Dhaliwal, R., Jurewitsch, B., Stapleton, R. D., Jeejeebhoy, K. N. and Heyland, D. K.				intensive care medicine	intensive care medicine	PURPOSE: Parenteral lipid emulsions (LEs) are commonly rich in long-chain triglycerides derived from soybean oil (SO). SO-containing emulsions may promote systemic inflammation and therefore may adversely affect clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that alternative oil-based LEs (SO-sparing strategies) may improve clinical outcomes in critically ill adult patients compared to products containing SO emulsion only. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of parenteral SO-sparing strategies on clinical outcomes in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: We searched computerized databases from 1980 to 2013. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in critically ill adult patients that evaluated SO-sparing strategies versus SO-based LEs in the context of parenteral nutrition. RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. When the results of these RCTs were statistically aggregated, SO-sparing strategies were associated with clinically important reductions in mortality (risk ratio, RR 0.83; 95 % confidence intervals, CI 0.62, 1.11; P = 0.20), in duration of ventilation (weighted mean difference, WMD -2.57; 95 % CI -5.51, 0.37; P = 0.09), and in ICU length of stay (LOS) (WMD -2.31; 95 % CI -5.28, 0.66; P = 0.13) but none of these differences were statistically significant. SO-sparing strategies had no effect on infectious complications (RR 1.13; 95 % CI 0.87, 1.46; P = 0.35). CONCLUSION: Alternative oil-based LEs may be associated with clinically important reductions in mortality, duration of ventilation, and ICU LOS but lack of statistical precision precludes any clinical recommendations at this time. Further research is warranted to confirm these potential positive treatment effects.			2013				2994
Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) vs other treatment modalities for glaucoma: systematic review		McAlinden, C.				eye (london, england)	eye (london, england)	PURPOSE: Systemic review to compare selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) to other glaucoma treatment options in terms of their intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect. METHODS: Searches of the following databases were performed: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid, EMBASE, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in peer-reviewed journals comparing SLT to other glaucoma treatment options were considered. The main outcome measure was the change in IOP from baseline. RESULTS: An initial search of PubMed identified 23 RCTs with 17 meeting the inclusion criteria. Nine RCTs compared 180° SLT to 180° argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) and one trial compared 360° SLT to 360° ALT, all reporting no difference in terms of IOP reduction from baseline. One RCT reported better outcomes with SLT at 1 year but this effect regressed at 2 years. Three trials compared 360° SLT to medical therapy and found no difference between the two treatment options. One trial found greater IOP reduction with latanoprost vs 90° and 180° SLT, and greater IOP reduction with 180° and 360° SLT versus 90° SLT, however no differences were found between 360° SLT versus latanoprost or 360° vs 180° SLT. Two trials compared 180° SLT to 360° SLT finding no difference in IOP reduction. Two trials compared 180° SLT to 90° SLT, one finding no significant difference and one finding greater IOP reduction with 180° SLT over 90° SLT. One trial compared excimer laser trabeculotomy (ELT) to 180° SLT, finding no differences in IOP reduction up to 3 months follow-up but greater IOP reduction with ELT at time intervals between 9 and 24 months. There were no RCTs identified that compared SLT to surgery. CONCLUSION: In terms of the IOP lowering effect, there is no difference between SLT and ALT. Three trials indicate no difference between 360° SLT and medical therapy, with one of the trials indicating greater IOP reduction with latanoprost over 90° and 180° SLT. Three trials indicate no difference between 180° SLT and 360° SLT. It is inconclusive whether 90° is less efficacious than 180° SLT. One trial reports greater IOP reduction with ELT over 180° SLT in the long term.			2014				3499
Community services' involvement in the discharge of older adults from hospital into the community		Guerin, M., Grimmer, K. and Kumar, S.				international journal of integrated care	international journal of integrated care	BACKGROUND: Community services are playing an increasing role in supporting older adults who are discharged from hospital with ongoing non-acute care needs. However, there is a paucity of information regarding how community services are involved in the discharge process of older individuals from hospital into the community. METHODS: Twenty-nine databases were searched from 1980 to 2012 (inclusive) for relevant primary published research, of any study design, as well as relevant unpublished work (e.g. clinical guidelines) which investigated community services' involvement in the discharge of older individuals from hospital into the community. Data analysis and quality appraisal (using McMaster critical appraisal tools) were undertaken predominately by the lead author. Data was synthesised qualitatively. RESULTS: Twelve papers were eligible for inclusion (five randomised controlled trials, four before and after studies and three controlled trials), involving a total of 8440 older adults (>65 years). These papers reported on a range of interventions. During data synthesis, descriptors were assigned to four emergent discharge methods: Virtual Interface Model, In-reach Interface Model, Out-reach Interface Model and Independent Interface Model. In each model, the findings were mixed in terms of health care and patient and carer outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: It is plausible that each model identified in this systematic review has a role to play in successfully discharging different cohorts of older adults from hospital. Further research is required to identify appropriate population groups for various discharge models and to select suitable outcome measures to determine the effectiveness of these models, considering all stakeholders' involved.			2013				3917
Does urine drug abuse screening help for managing patients? A systematic review		Dupouy, J., Mémier, V., Catala, H., Lavit, M., Oustric, S. and Lapeyre-Mestre, M.				drug and alcohol dependence	drug and alcohol dependence	BACKGROUND: In the field of addiction, assessment of psychoactive substance use is a key element. Nevertheless, self-reports and clinical examination underestimate the use of psychoactive substances. The implementation of urine drug screening tests (UDS) should improve this assessment. While the diagnostic value of UDS is well demonstrated, the consequences of carrying out UDS on medical management have not been established. Our aim was to summarize the evidence pertaining to the efficacy of UDS for medical management. METHODS: A systematic review of clinical trials, quasi-randomized and observational studies was performed using PubMed, Cochrane database of systematic review, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, PsycINFO, National Institute on Drug Abuse, ISI Web of Science. The methodological quality was assessed with the score developed by Starrels et al.; the report quality using the CONSORT and the STROBE checklists. The main outcome was medical management or consequences of management for patients in terms of psychoactive substance consumption and its complications, be they medical, social or professional. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria: one randomized clinical trial, two quasi-randomized studies, one cohort, and four cross-sectional studies. The methodological quality was judged to be poor, with the exception of the randomized clinical trial (fair quality). The value of UDS in managing patients was not clearly indicated in these studies. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies, with poor quality, have assessed the value of UDS in managing patients using psychoactive substances; though with insufficiency to demonstrate the interest of carrying out UDS. Therefore, pragmatic intervention studies are necessary.			2014				2753
Use of high-sensitivity troponin assays predicts mortality in patients with normal conventional troponin assays on admission-insights from a meta-analysis		Chatterjee, S., Kim, J., Dahhan, A., Choudhary, G., Sharma, S. and Wu, W. C.				clinical cardiology	clinical cardiology	BACKGROUND: Use of high-sensitivity troponin (hs-Tn) assays can detect small levels of myocardial damage previously undetectable with conventional troponin (c-Tn) assays. However, prognostic utility of these hs-Tn assays in prediction of mortality remains unclear in the presence of nonelevated c-Tn levels on admission. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess mortality risk of patients with hs-Tn elevations in the setting of normal c-Tn levels. HYPOTHESIS: Patients with hs-Tn elevations with normal c-Tn levels on admission blood samples, drawn to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS), have a higher mortality risk than those without hs-Tn or c-Tn elevations. METHODS: A search was made of the PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, EBSCO, and Web of Science databases. Studies evaluating patients with suspected ACS that reported mortality rates for those with elevated hs-Tn levels but normal c-Tn levels on admission were included. A random-effects model was used to pool event rates, and data were reported in odds ratios (95% confidence interval). RESULTS: Four studies (N = 2033, mean age 64-75 years, 49%-70% male) revealed that nearly 32% of suspected ACS patients with normal c-Tn levels on admission had elevated hs-Tn levels. Elevated hs-Tn levels conferred a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality vs normal hs-Tn levels (odds ratio: 4.35, 95% confidence interval: 2.81-6.73, P < 0.01), with negligible heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of hs-Tn levels predicted a higher risk of mortality in patients with suspected ACS and may aid in the early identification of higher-risk patients in this setting. Future studies are needed to investigate further optimal management strategies.			2013				3990
Neuroendoscopic resection of intraventricular tumors: a systematic outcomes analysis		Barber, S. M., Rangel-Castilla, L. and Baskin, D.				minimally invasive surgery	minimally invasive surgery	Introduction. Though traditional microsurgical techniques are the gold standard for intraventricular tumor resection, the morbidity and invasiveness of microsurgical approaches to the ventricular system have galvanized interest in neuroendoscopic resection. We present a systematic review of the literature to provide a better understanding of the virtues and limitations of endoscopic tumor resection. Materials and Methods. 40 articles describing 668 endoscopic tumor resections were selected from the Pubmed database and reviewed. Results. Complete or near-complete resection was achieved in 75.0% of the patients. 9.9% of resected tumors recurred during the follow-up period, and procedure-related complications occurred in 20.8% of the procedures. Tumor size ? 2cm (P = 0.00146), the presence of a cystic tumor component (P < 0.0001), and the use of navigation or stereotactic tools during the procedure (P = 0.0003) were each independently associated with a greater likelihood of complete or near-complete tumor resection. Additionally, the complication rate was significantly higher for noncystic masses than for cystic ones (P < 0.0001). Discussion. Neuroendoscopic outcomes for intraventricular tumor resection are significantly better when performed on small, cystic tumors and when neural navigation or stereotaxy is used. Conclusion. Neuroendoscopic resection appears to be a safe and reliable treatment option for patients with intraventricular tumors of a particular morphology.			2013				3849
Transtibial Versus Independent Drilling Techniques for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Meta-regression		Riboh, J. C., Hasselblad, V., Godin, J. A. and Mather, R. C.				the american journal of sports medicine	the american journal of sports medicine	BACKGROUND: While numerous cadaveric, in vivo, and clinical studies have compared transtibial and independent drilling of femoral tunnels during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, there is no evidence-based consensus on which technique affords the best outcome. HYPOTHESIS: There is no difference in clinical outcome between transtibial and independent drilling of femoral tunnels. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression. METHODS: Cadaveric, in vivo, and clinical studies comparing transtibial and independent drilling techniques were systematically identified. A qualitative synthesis of nonrandomized studies and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed. In addition, a meta-regression analysis of RCTs that did not directly compare drilling techniques was performed. RESULTS: A total of 49 studies were included in the qualitative review, and 15 were included in the meta-analysis; 22 studies were included in the meta-regression. In biomechanical studies, independent drilling placed the center of the femoral tunnel closer to the center of the femoral footprint (mean difference, 2.69 mm; 95% CI, 0.46-4.92; P < .00001). Independent drilling reduced anterior tibial translation with the Lachman examination (mean difference, 2.2 mm; 95% CI, 0.34-4.07; P = .02), 134 N of anterior load (mean difference, 1 mm; 95% CI, 0.29-1.71; P = .006), and simulated pivot shift (mean difference, 3.36 mm; 95% CI, 1.88-4.85; P < .00001). The meta-analysis showed improved Lysholm scores with independent drilling (mean difference, -0.62 points; 95% CI, -1.09 to -0.55; P = .009), although the clinical relevance of this small difference is questionable. There were no significant differences in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) objective scores or Tegner scores between groups. With the meta-regression, there were no significant differences in failure rates or IKDC objective scores. CONCLUSION: While there are biomechanical data suggesting improved knee stability and more anatomic graft placement with independent drilling, no significant clinical differences were found between the 2 techniques. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The current evidence shows that transtibial and independent drilling techniques have equivalent clinical outcomes at short-term to midterm follow-up. The long-term effects of subtle differences in tunnel position and postoperative knee kinematics should be further studied in dedicated, prospective cohort and randomized studies.			2013				2960
Effects of ranolazine in symptomatic patients with stable coronary artery disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis		Savarese, G., Rosano, G., D'Amore, C., Musella, F., Della Ratta, G. L., Pellegrino, A. M., Formisano, T., Vitagliano, A., Cirillo, A., Cice, G., Fimiani, L., Del Guercio, L., Trimarco, B. and Perrone-Filardi, P.				international journal of cardiology	international journal of cardiology	BACKGROUND: Ranolazine (R), as add-on therapy in symptomatic patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease (CAD), has been tested in randomized clinical studies. Aim of the study was to assess in a meta-analysis the effects of R on angina, nitroglycerin consumption, functional capacity, electrocardiographic signs of ischemia and hemodynamic parameters in patients with chronic CAD. METHODS: Randomized trials assessing the effects of R compared to control on exercise duration, time to onset of angina, time to 1mm ST-segment depression, weekly nitroglycerin consumption and weekly angina frequency were included in the analysis. The effects of R compared to control on heart rate and blood pressure were also analyzed. RESULTS: Six trials enrolling 9223 patients were included in the analysis. At trough and peak levels, R compared to control significantly improved exercise duration, time to onset of angina and time to 1mm ST-segment depression. Additionally, R compared to control significantly reduced weekly angina frequency and weekly nitroglycerin consumption. Finally, R compared to control did not significantly reduce supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate, standing heart rate and diastolic blood pressure, whereas it modestly reduced standing systolic blood pressure. At sensitivity analysis, results were not influenced by concomitant background therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic patients with chronic CAD, R, added to conventional therapy, effectively reduces angina frequency and sublingual nitroglycerin consumption while prolonging exercise duration as well as time to onset of ischemia and to onset of angina with no substantial effects on blood pressure and heart rate.			2013				3335
Interventions to improve symptoms and quality of life of patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease: a systematic review of the literature		Bajwah, S., Ross, J. R., Peacock, J. L., Higginson, I. J., Wells, A. U., Patel, A. S., Koffman, J. and Riley, J.				thorax	thorax	BACKGROUND: Patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease have symptom control and quality of life (QoL) needs. This review aims to evaluate the evidence for the use of interventions in improving dyspnoea, other symptoms and QoL. METHODS: Eleven databases, relevant websites and key journals were hand-searched. Studies were assessed and data extracted independently by two researchers using standardised proformas. Meta-analyses were performed where possible with 95% CI. RESULTS: 34 papers with 19 interventions in 3635 patients were included. Meta-analyses showed no significant effect of interferon ?-1b or sildenafil on 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) or dyspnoea. Pulmonary rehabilitation and pirfenidone had a positive effect on 6MWD (mean difference (95% CI) 27.4 (4.1 to 50.7)) and 24.0 (4.3 to 43.7), respectively), and pulmonary rehabilitation had a mixed effect on dyspnoea. Both pulmonary rehabilitation and sildenafil showed a trend towards significance in improving QoL. There was weak evidence for the improvement of 6MWD using oxygen; dyspnoea using prednisolone, diamorphine, D-pencillamine and colchicine; cough using interferon ? and thalidomide; anxiety using diamorphine; fatigue using pulmonary rehabilitation; and QoL using thalidomide and doxycycline. A wide range of outcome scales was used and there were no studies with economic evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence for the use of pulmonary rehabilitation and pirfenidone to improve 6MWD and moderate evidence for the use of sildenafil and pulmonary rehabilitation to improve QoL. Future recommendations for research would include careful consideration of the dichotomy of radical and palliative treatments when deciding on how symptom and QoL outcome measures are used and data presented.			2013				3654
A systematic review of health service interventions to improve linkage with or retention in HIV care		Brennan, A., Browne, J. P. and Horgan, M.				aids care	aids care	The importance of early linkage to and continuing retention in HIV care is increasingly recognised, particularly in light of the implications poor linkage and retention rates have for the effectiveness of HIV treatment as prevention strategies. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of healthcare interventions in improving patient linkage to or retention in HIV care. We systematically searched PubMed (MEDLINE and PubMed-only citations) and EMBASE databases for articles reporting the original results of randomised controlled trials, and used a standard data collection form to extract information on study characteristics and outcome data. Five articles met the inclusion criteria, of which two articles focused on linkage to care and three on retention in care. The methodological quality, both of internal and external validity, of most of the trials was suboptimal. Wide variation in the interventions and outcome measures meant synthesis of the results using meta-analysis was not appropriate. This review shows evidence that interventions based on supporting patient self-management improves linkage to, and possibly retention in, care. Interventions aimed at delivery service design may also be effective, although evidence in this review was limited. It is vital that interventions are developed to improve patient engagement in HIV care. The dearth of research identified by this review highlights the need for well-designed trials of interventions in this area in the future.			2014				2760
Effect of Different Insoles on Postural Balance: A Systematic Review		ChristovÃO, Thaluanna Calil LourenÇO, Neto, Hugo Pasini, Grecco, Luanda AndrÉ Collange, Ferreira, Luiz Alfredo Braun, De Moura, Renata Calhes Franco, De Souza, Maria Eliege, De Oliveira, Luis Vicente Franco and Oliveira, Claudia Santos				journal of physical therapy science	journal of physical therapy science	[Purpose] The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the effect of different insoles on postural balance. [Subjects and Methods] A systematic review was conducted of four databases. The papers retrieved were evaluated based on the following inclusion criteria: 1) design: controlled clinical trial; 2) intervention: insole; 3) outcome: change in static postural balance; and 4) year of publication: 2005 to 2012. [Results] Twelve controlled trials were found comparing the effects of different insoles on postural balance. The papers had methodological quality scores of 3 or 4 on the PEDro scale. [Conclusion] Insoles have benefits that favor better postural balance and control.			2013				2642
Rituximab in systemic lupus erythematosus: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis		Duxbury, B., Combescure, C. and Chizzolini, C.				lupus	lupus	The wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and high relapse rate represent a therapeutic challenge in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Observational studies suggested efficacy of rituximab (RTX), a B-cell-targeting antibody, to control the activity of SLE. Two randomized trials controlled by placebo did not prove the superiority of RTX when used in addition to conventional treatment in nonrenal (EXPLORER) and renal (LUNAR) lupus. A systematic review of studies exploring the efficacy of RTX in SLE patients was conducted. The pooled percentages of response were assessed. Thirty studies with 1243 patients were analyzed. In studies using the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG), the complete response (CR) rate was 46.7% (95% CI 36.8%-56.8%) and the partial response (PR) was 37.9% (95% CI 30.6%-45.8%). With the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), the CR was 56.6% (95% CI 32.4%-78.1%) and the PR was 30.9% (95% CI 8.9%-46%). In renal lupus the CR was 36.1% (95% CI 25.2%-48.6%); PR was 37.4% (95% CI 28.5%-47.3%). In EXPLORER, CR was 12.4% and PR was 17.2%; in LUNAR CR was 26.4% and PR was 30.6%, in both cases not different from controls. Assessment and standardization of SLE response to treatment remain a challenge. The discrepancy in the perceived efficacy of RTX between controlled and observational studies reflects the heterogeneity of lupus and stringency in criteria of response. Further randomized trials focusing on selected SLE manifestations and using composite response indices are warranted.			2013				2977
Acupuncture and other physical treatments for the relief of pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee: network meta-analysis		Corbett, M. S., Rice, S. J., Madurasinghe, V., Slack, R., Fayter, D. A., Harden, M., Sutton, A. J., Macpherson, H. and Woolacott, N. F.				osteoarthritis and cartilage / oars, osteoarthritis research society	osteoarthritis and cartilage / oars, osteoarthritis research society	OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of acupuncture with other relevant physical treatments for alleviating pain due to knee osteoarthritis. DESIGN: Systematic review with network meta-analysis, to allow comparison of treatments within a coherent framework. Comprehensive searches were undertaken up to January 2013 to identify randomised controlled trials in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, which reported pain. RESULTS: Of 156 eligible studies, 114 trials (covering 22 treatments and 9,709 patients) provided data suitable for analysis. Most trials studied short-term effects and many were classed as being of poor quality with high risk of bias, commonly associated with lack of blinding (which was sometimes impossible to achieve). End of treatment results showed that eight interventions: interferential therapy, acupuncture, TENS, pulsed electrical stimulation, balneotherapy, aerobic exercise, sham acupuncture, and muscle-strengthening exercise produced a statistically significant reduction in pain when compared with standard care. In a sensitivity analysis of satisfactory and good quality studies, most studies were of acupuncture (11 trials) or muscle-strengthening exercise (9 trials); both interventions were statistically significantly better than standard care, with acupuncture being statistically significantly better than muscle-strengthening exercise (standardised mean difference: 0.49, 95% credible interval 0.00-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: As a summary of the current available research, the network meta-analysis results indicate that acupuncture can be considered as one of the more effective physical treatments for alleviating osteoarthritis knee pain in the short-term. However, much of the evidence in this area of research is of poor quality, meaning there is uncertainty about the efficacy of many physical treatments.			2013				3907
[Implementing models of cross-sectoral mental health care (integrated health care, regional psychiatry budget) in Germany: systematic literature review]		Schmid, P., Steinert, T. and Borbé, R.				psychiatrische praxis	psychiatrische praxis	OBJECTIVE: Cross-sectoral integrated health-care and the regional psychiatry budget are two models of cross-sectoral health care (comprising in-patient and out-patient care) in Germany. Both models of financing were created in order to overcome the so-called fragmentation in German health care. The regional psychiatry budget is a specific solution for psychiatric services whereas integrated health care models can be developed for all areas of health care. The purpose of this overview is to elucidate both the current state of implementation of these models and the results of evaluation research. METHODS: Systematic literature review, additional manual search. RESULTS: 28 journal articles and 38 websites referring to 21 projects were identified. The projects are highly heterogenuous in terms of size, included populations and services, aims, and steering-function (concerning the different pathways of care). CONCLUSIONS: The projects yield innovative models of mental health care capable of competing with the co-existing traditional financing systems of in-patient and out-patient services. The future of mental health care organisation in Germany is currently open and under political discussion.			2013				3114
Treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review		O'Horo, J. C., Jindai, K., Kunzer, B. and Safdar, N.				infection	infection	BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) recurs in nearly one-third of patients who develop an initial infection. Recurrent CDI (RCDI) is associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and cost. Treatment for RCDI has not been not well examined. METHODS: A systematic review. RESULTS: Sixty-four articles were identified evaluating eight different treatment approaches: metronidazole, vancomycin, fidaxomicin, nitazoxanide, rifampin, immunoglobulins, probiotics, and fecal bacteriotherapy. The meta-analysis found vancomycin to have a similar efficacy to metronidazole, although studies used varying doses and durations of therapy. Fidaxomicin was slightly more efficacious than vancomycin, though the number of studies was small. Good evidence for probiotics was limited. Fecal bacteriotherapy was found to be highly efficacious in a single randomized trial. CONCLUSION: Metronidazole and vancomycin have good evidence for use in RCDI but heterogeneity in treatment duration and dose precludes robust conclusions. Fidaxomicin may have a role in treatment, but evidence is limited to subgroup analyses. Fecal bacteriotherapy was the most efficacious. Saccharomyces boulardii may have a role as adjunctive treatment.			2014				2663
Efficacy and safety of probiotics in preterm infants		AlFaleh, K. and Anabrees, J.				journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine	journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine	Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that beneficially affect the recipient by improving intestinal balance. In an updated systematic review, nineteen trials randomizing more than 2800 infants were included. In a meta-analysis of trial data, enteral probiotic supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of severe necrotizing enterocolitis (typical RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.52) and mortality (typical RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.74). There was no evidence of significant reduction of nosocomial sepsis (typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03). The included trials reported no systemic infection with - supplemented probiotics. Recent data in addition to a report by the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology (ESPGAN) concluded probiotics could be generally considered safe.			2013				3722
Comparison of gastrointestinal adverse effects between cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and non-selective, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs plus proton pump inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Jarupongprapa, S., Ussavasodhi, P. and Katchamart, W.				journal of gastroenterology	journal of gastroenterology	BACKGROUND: There are conflicting and inconsistent data regarding the gastrointestinal (GI) protective effect of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) plus proton-pump inhibitors (PPI). AIM: To compare the adverse GI effects between COX-2 inhibitors and NSAIDs plus PPI. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of randomized trials comparing GI adverse effects between COX-2 inhibitors and NSAID plus PPI. Trials were identified in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Primary outcomes were major GI complications including hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction. RESULTS: A total of nine trials involving 7,616 participants from 2002 to 2011 were included. All trials were randomized, double blinded, and placebo-controlled with moderate to high quality. COX-2 inhibitors were found to have significantly reduced the risk of major GI events, including perforation, obstruction, and bleeding (relative risk or RR 0.38, 95 % confidence interval or CI 0.25-0.56, p < 0.001); however, the benefit was significant only for patients who were at high risk for NSAID-related GI complications and long-term users. Additionally, the risk of diarrhea (RR 0.56, 95 % CI 0.35-0.9, p 0.02) and withdrawal (RR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.62-0.94, p 0.01) was significantly lower in use of COX-2 inhibitors, while the rate of dyspepsia was higher (RR 1.58, 95 % CI 1.26-1.98, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COX-2 inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of perforation, obstruction, bleeding, diarrhea, and withdrawal due to GI adverse events, while the risk of dyspepsia was lower with NSAIDs plus PPI.			2013				3219
The efficacy of nonestrogenic therapy to hot flashes in cancer patients under hormone manipulation therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Yamaguchi, N., Okajima, Y., Fujii, T., Natori, A. and Kobayashi, D.				journal of cancer research and clinical oncology	journal of cancer research and clinical oncology	PURPOSE: The incidence of hot flashes under hormone manipulation therapy is so high that this symptom caused by sex hormone blocking agents has been bothering patients and has a negative impact on their quality of life. Venlafaxine and gabapentin are most promising novel nonestrogenic agents to control the symptom. We seek to quatitatively summarize the efficacy of these novel agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies on the efficacy of venlafaxine/gabapentin to hot flashes in cancer patient under hormone deprivation therapies. A search for Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ichushi, and Google Scholar yielded 733 citations, which were independently assessed by two authors. We estimated overall effect sizes and its 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the efficacy of these agents compared with the controls with standardized mean difference. RESULTS: A total of 5 studies involving 588 cancer patients with hot flashes finally fulfilled the predefined inclusion criteria. Overall effect size of the efficacy of venlafaxine/gabapentin was -0.630 (95 % CI [-0.801, -0.459]). CONCLUSION: Venlafaxine/gabapentin significantly improved hot flashes in cancer patients under hormone manipulation therapies.			2013				3529
Antioxidant nutrients and age-related cognitive decline: a systematic review of population-based cohort studies		Rafnsson, S. B., Dilis, V. and Trichopoulou, A.				european journal of nutrition	european journal of nutrition	Purpose: To further inform the debate on the possible cognitive benefits of antioxidant nutrients in the elderly, we systematically reviewed available prospective studies while paying a special attention to their methodological quality. Methods: This is a systematic review of studies involving major antioxidant nutrients and change in cognitive performance. Abstracts were independently reviewed; studies were selected based on prespecified criteria. Methodological quality of primary studies was assessed using a methodological checklist for cohort studies. Findings were presented using a narrative synthesis and tabulation of results. Results: Eight-hundred and fifty potentially eligible studies were identified; 10 met the inclusion criteria and were retained for data extraction and appraisal. The main supportive evidence came from two studies, both judged to be of high quality: The first observed an accelerated decline in global cognition, attention, and psychomotor speed over 9 years, concomitant to a decrease in plasma selenium levels over the same period; the second study reported a slower rate of global cognitive decline over 3 years in persons in the highest quartile of intake of vitamins C, E, and carotenes. All associations persisted after adjustment for confounding factors. Evidence in favor of beneficial associations of higher dietary intake of vitamin E and flavonoids, as well as higher serum beta carotene levels, came from further studies of only adequate quality. Conclusions: There is a possibility for protective effects of antioxidant nutrients against decline in cognition in older people although the supportive evidence is still limited in number. This association deserves further examination in additional quality investigations.			2013				2932
Meta-analysis of randomized trials on single-incision laparoscopic versus conventional laparoscopic appendectomy		Antoniou, S. A., Koch, O. O., Antoniou, G. A., Lasithiotakis, K., Chalkiadakis, G. E., Pointner, R. and Granderath, F. A.				american journal of surgery	american journal of surgery	BACKGROUND: Single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy has emerged as a less invasive alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery. High-quality relevant evidence is limited. METHODS: A systematic review of electronic information sources was undertaken, with the objective of identifying randomized trials that compared single-incision with conventional laparoscopic appendectomy. Outcome measures included 30-day morbidity, abdominal abscess, wound infection, open conversion, reoperation, operative time, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain. Fixed-effects and random-effects models were used to calculate combined overall effect sizes of pooled data. Data are presented as odds ratios or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Five randomized trials were identified, with a total of 746 patients. Thirty-day morbidity (9.6% vs 8.6%; odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, .69 to 1.89) and wound infection rates were similar between single-incision and conventional laparoscopy (4.0% vs 4.8%; odds ratio, .83; 95% CI, .41 to 1.68), whereas the duration of surgery was longer in the single-incision group (46.3 vs 40.7 minutes; weighted mean difference, 6.01; 95% CI, 2.26 to 9.76). Available data were not adequately robust to reach conclusions regarding the remaining outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Similar postoperative morbidity and wound infection rates for single-incision and conventional laparoscopic appendectomy are supported by the current literature, but single-incision surgery requires longer operative time.			2014				3901
A systematic review of non-surgical treatments for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours		Valle, J. W., Eatock, M., Clueit, B., Gabriel, Z., Ferdinand, R. and Mitchell, S.				cancer treatment reviews	cancer treatment reviews	INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) are rare and the majority of patients present with advanced disease. Such patients have limited treatment options. We conducted a systematic review of published clinical trials of non-surgical interventions in pNET, to understand the efficacy, safety and health related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes from the current evidence base. METHODS: Electronic databases and manual bibliographic searches were conducted to identify relevant studies. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Forty seven clinical studies met the predefined inclusion criteria. The following interventions were included: targeted therapies (two RCTs and six single-arm studies), chemotherapy (two RCTs, one prospective nonrandomised, comparative study and 14 single-arm studies);somatostatin analogues (SSA) and radiolabeled SSA therapies (nine single-arm studies), liver-directed therapies (six single-arm studies), mixed treatment regimens (one RCT, four single-arm studies) and other interventions such as interferon and recombinant human endostatin (one single-arm study for each). The paucity of RCT data and lack of consistency in reporting validated study outcomes and differing patient inclusion criteria between studies made it difficult to compare the relative efficacy of therapies. DISCUSSION: The majority of published studies assessing treatment regimens for the management of pNET are single arm, non-randomised studies, often enrolling a small number of patients and not reporting clinically meaningful outcomes. However data from recently conducted studies assessing targeted therapies indicate that it is possible to conduct adequately powered RCTs reporting standardised oncological endpoints in this rare cancer. Further, similarly robust studies should be conducted to define the optimal treatment algorithm.			2014				2702
Meta-analysis comparing carvedilol versus metoprolol for the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation following coronary artery bypass grafting		Dinicolantonio, J. J., Beavers, C. J., Menezes, A. R., Lavie, C. J., O'Keefe, J. H., Meier, P., Vorobcsuk, A., Aradi, D., Komócsi, A., Chatterjee, S., D'Ascenzo, F., Gasparini, M., Brugts, J. and Biondi-Zoccai, G.				the american journal of cardiology	the american journal of cardiology	A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol on the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in randomized controlled trials. Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, CENTRAL, and Excepta Medica (EMBASE) were searched up to March 2013 for suitable randomized controlled trials. Data were pooled using random-effects model for pairwise analyses. A total of 4 trials with 601 patients were included in this analysis. Pairwise analyses showed that compared with metoprolol, carvedilol significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.80). In conclusion, compared with metoprolol, carvedilol significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.			2014				3729
Hand-held health records for individuals with intellectual disability: a systematic review		Nguyen, M., Lennox, N. and Ware, R.				journal of intellectual disability research : jidr	journal of intellectual disability research : jidr	Background Hand-held health records ( HHHRs) aim to empower individuals with intellectual disability ( ID) and improve the communication between all those involved in their health care. HHHRs can be used to identify additional health needs and contribute to improved treatment for individuals with ID. This review summarises evidence concerning the use of HHHRs with individuals with ID. Methods Systematic searching of electronic databases and email contact with established researchers in the field were used to identify relevant articles related to the use of HHHRs among individuals with ID. Results Seven articles were identified and included for review. Studies involved the development, evaluation, acceptability and facilitators and barriers of implementation of HHHRs. HHHRs did not lead to improved short-term healthcare activity, but did lead to more discussion about health problems, increased health-related knowledge and awareness of personal health issues. Conclusions HHHRs are well accepted among users with ID. However, no short-term benefits were found and future research needs to examine the long-term effects of HHHRs.			2014				2743
How to improve change of shift handovers and collaborative grounding and what role does the electronic patient record system play? Results of a systematic literature review		Flemming, D. and Hübner, U.				international journal of medical informatics	international journal of medical informatics	"INTRODUCTION: Establishing continuity of care in handovers at changes of shift is a challenging endeavor that is jeopardized by time pressure and errors typically occurring during synchronous communication. Only if the outgoing and incoming persons manage to collaboratively build a common ground for the next steps of care is it possible to ensure a proper continuation. Electronic systems, in particular electronic patient record systems, are powerful providers of information but their actual use might threaten achieving a common understanding of the patient if they force clinicians to work asynchronously. In order to gain a deeper understanding of communication failures and how to overcome them, we performed a systematic review of the literature, aiming to answer the following four research questions: (1a) What are typical errors and (1b) their consequences in handovers? (2) How can they be overcome by conventional strategies and instruments? (3) electronic systems? (4) Are there any instruments to support collaborative grounding? METHODS: We searched the databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, and COCHRANE for articles on handovers in general and in combination with the terms electronic record systems and grounding that covered the time period of January 2000 to May 2012. RESULTS: The search led to 519 articles of which 60 were then finally included into the review. We found a sharp increase in the number of relevant studies starting with 2008. As could be documented by 20 studies that addressed communication errors, omission of detailed patient information including anticipatory guidance during handovers was the greatest problem. This deficiency could be partly overcome by structuring and systematizing the information, e.g. according to Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation schema (SBAR), and by employing electronic tools integrated in electronic records systems as 23 studies on conventional and 22 articles on electronic systems showed. Despite the increase in quantity and quality of the information achieved, it also became clear that there was still the unsolved problem of anticipatory guidance and presenting ""the full story"" of the patient. Only a small number of studies actually addressed how to establish common ground with the help of electronic tools. DISCUSSION: The increase in studies manifests the rise of great interest in the handover scenario. Electronic patient record systems proved to be excellent information feeders to handover tools, but their role in collaborative grounding is unclear. Concepts of how to move to joint information processing and IT-enabled social interaction have to be implemented and tested."			2013				3225
Evidence-based treatment for Depersonalisation-derealisation Disorder (DPRD)		Somer, E., Amos-Williams, T. and Stein, D. J.				bmc psychology	bmc psychology	BACKGROUND: Depersonalisation-derealisation disorder (DPRD) is a distressing and impairing condition with a pathophysiology that is not well understood. Nevertheless, given the growing interest in its pathogenesis, and the publication of a number of treatment trials, a systematic review of randomised controlled pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy trials is timely. METHODS: A systematic search of articles on DPRD published from January 1980 to August 2012, using Cochrane methods, was conducted. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, somatic interventions and a blend of these modalities for the treatment of depersonalisation disorder were included in the review. Searches were carried out on multiple databases. The bibliographies of all identified trials were checked for additional studies and authors were contacted for published trials. No unpublished trials were found and no restrictions were placed on language and setting. Data extraction sheets were further designed to enter specified data from each trial and risk of bias information was identified. PRISMA guidelines were also followed to ensure that our methodology and reporting were comprehensive. Of the unique 1296 papers that were retrieved, four studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. RESULTS: Four RCTs (all within the duration of 12 weeks or less) met study criteria and were included (180 participants; age range 18-65 years). The four RCTs included two lamotrigine studies, one fluoxetine study and one biofeedback study. Evidence for the treatment efficacy of lamotrigine was found in one study (Cambridge Dissociation Scale, CDC: p < 0.001) with no evidence of effect for lamotrigine in the second study (CDS: p = 0.61 or Present State Examination: p = 0.17). Fluoxetine and biofeedback were not more efficacious than the control condition, although there was a trend for fluoxetine to demonstrate greater efficacy in those with comorbid anxiety disorder. The four studies had 'low' or 'unclear' risk of bias. CONCLUSION: The limited data from randomised controlled trials on the pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy of DPRD demonstrates inconsistent evidence for the efficacy of lamotrigine, and no efficacy for other interventions. Additional research on this disorder is needed.			2013				3812
Meta-analysis of noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant use in schizophrenia		Kishi, T. and Iwata, N.				the international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / official scientific journal of the collegium internationale neuropsychopharmacologicum (cinp)	the international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / official scientific journal of the collegium internationale neuropsychopharmacologicum (cinp)	We examined whether noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSAs: mirtazapine and mianserin), as augmentation therapy, have therapeutic potential for schizophrenia treatment. A systematic review was conducted of PubMed, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO in December 2012 and meta-analyses of double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trials were performed. Standardized mean difference (SMD), risk ratio (RR), number-needed-to-treat (NNT), number-needed-to-harm (NNH) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results were across 12 studies and 362 patients were included (mirtazapine: seven trials and 221 patients; mianserin: five trials and 141 patients). NaSSA augmentation therapy was superior to placebo in overall symptoms (S.M.D. = -0.75, CI -1.24 to -0.26, p = 0.003, N = 11, n = 301), negative symptoms (S.M.D. = -0.88, CI -1.41 to -0.34, p = 0.001, N = 9, n = 240) and response rate (RR = 0.71, CI 0.57-0.88, p = 0.002, NNT = 4, p<0.00001, N = 6, n = 163). There was no significant difference in positive symptoms, depressive symptoms or discontinuation rate between NaSSAs and placebo treatments. In addition, no patients who received NaSSAs developed worsening psychosis during the study. For individual NaSSAs, mirtazapine was superior to placebo in overall symptoms (S.M.D. = 0.98, CI = -1.74 to -0.22, p = 0.01, N = 7, n = 194), negative symptoms (S.M.D. = -1.25, CI -1.88 to -0.62, p = 0.0001, N = 6, n = 172) and response rate (RR = 0.70, p = 0.04, NNT = 4, p = 0.0004, N = 4, n = 119). Moreover, NaSSAs were associated with reduced akathisia score (p < 0.00001) and extrapyramidal symptom scales (p = 0.01). However, NaSSAs caused drowsiness/sedation/somnolence compared with placebo (RR = 3.52, p = 0.002, NNT = 6, p = 0.01, N = 8, n = 209). Our results indicate that NaSSA (especially mirtazapine) augmentation therapy improved overall and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Because the included studies were small, the results should be treated with caution.			2014				4012
Fall detection with body-worn sensors : a systematic review		Schwickert, L., Becker, C., Lindemann, U., Maréchal, C., Bourke, A., Chiari, L., Helbostad, J. L., Zijlstra, W., Aminian, K., Todd, C., Bandinelli, S., Klenk, J., Consortium, Farseeing and the, Farseeing Meta Database Consensus Group				zeitschrift für gerontologie und geriatrie	zeitschrift für gerontologie und geriatrie	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Falls among older people remain a major public health challenge. Body-worn sensors are needed to improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and kinematics of falls. The aim of this systematic review is to assemble, extract and critically discuss the information available in published studies, as well as the characteristics of these investigations (fall documentation and technical characteristics). METHODS: The searching of publically accessible electronic literature databases for articles on fall detection with body-worn sensors identified a collection of 96 records (33 journal articles, 60 conference proceedings and 3 project reports) published between 1998 and 2012. These publications were analysed by two independent expert reviewers. Information was extracted into a custom-built data form and processed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: The main findings were the lack of agreement between the methodology and documentation protocols (study, fall reporting and technical characteristics) used in the studies, as well as a substantial lack of real-world fall recordings. A methodological pitfall identified in most articles was the lack of an established fall definition. The types of sensors and their technical specifications varied considerably between studies. CONCLUSION: Limited methodological agreement between sensor-based fall detection studies using body-worn sensors was identified. Published evidence-based support for commercially available fall detection devices is still lacking. A worldwide research group consensus is needed to address fundamental issues such as incident verification, the establishment of guidelines for fall reporting and the development of a common fall definition.			2013				2696
Bortezomib for patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials		Zeng, Z., Lin, J. and Chen, J.				annals of hematology	annals of hematology	Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease with a poor survival, which has not been affected even by high-dose chemotherapy. This systematic review was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of the novel agent bortezomib for patients with previously untreated MM. We systematically searched biomedical literature databases and identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bortezomib with placebo, no bortezomib, or other active agents for patients with previously untreated MM. Overall survival (OS), reported as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), was the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcomes included time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and response rates. Five RCTs involving 2,728 patients were included. Three trials compared bortezomib with no bortezomib, and two compared bortezomib with other active agents (vincristine ± adriamycin-based chemotherapy). All included RCTs had methodological shortcomings, including no or unclear allocation concealment and blinding. Compared with no bortezomib or vincristine-based chemotherapy, the bortezomib-based regimen significantly improved the OS of patients with previously untreated MM. HR was 0.71 (95% CI 0.55-0.93) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.60-0.99), respectively. However, when compared with the vincristine + adriamycin-based regimen, the OS was similar (HR?=?0.87, 95% CI 0.57-1.33). TTP, PFS, and response rates were also improved in patients receiving bortezomib-based regimen. However, the risk of peripheral neuropathy was found to be significantly higher. In summary, bortezomib appears to improve survival and response rates of patients with previously untreated MM in spite of higher risk of peripheral neuropathy.			2013				3123
Comparison of the Efficacy and Safety of Low Molecular Weight Heparins for Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Medically Ill Patients		Dooley, C., Kaur, R. and Sobieraj, D. M.				current medical research and opinion	current medical research and opinion	OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and mixed-treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of low-molecular weight heparins LMWHs for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in hospitalized medically ill patients. As a secondary objective we compared all therapies within the network to each other. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search for randomized trials that evaluated pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized medically ill patients. We conducted a traditional meta-analysis for all pairwise comparisons using a random effects model, reporting relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals for each outcome. To determine the relative efficacy and safety of included therapies we conducted a MTC meta-analysis using a Bayesian framework, reporting RRs and 95 percent credible intervals for each outcome. RESULTS: Twenty trials met inclusion criteria. Enoxaparin, dalteparin, nadroparin and certoparin were the LMWH evaluated although none in direct comparative trials. Upon MTC, the relative efficacy of all LMWHs was similar in preventing morality and VTE and in the risk of major and minor bleeding Dalteparin was not included in the network to evaluate deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to lack of reported data and the remaining LMWHs were found to be similar in relative efficacy in preventing these outcomes. LIMITATIONS: Traditional meta-analysis was not possible for many drug comparisons made within the MTC. Heterogeneity was observed in several of the traditional meta-analyses although this may be an inherent limitation of the studied population. Overall rarity of events contributed to imprecise estimates demonstrated by the wide confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Enoxaparin, dalteparin, nadroparin and certoparin are similar in relative efficacy for the prevention of mortality and VTE and in the risk of major or minor bleeding while enoxaparin, nadroparin and certoparin are similar in relative efficacy for the prevention of PE and DVT in hospitalized medical patients.			2014				3804
Interventions for alcohol and drug problems in outpatient settings: a systematic review		Watson, J. M., Fayter, D., Mdege, N., Stirk, L., Sowden, A. J. and Godfrey, C.				drug and alcohol review	drug and alcohol review	ISSUES: Research evidence indicates a high prevalence of substance abuse among patients presenting in general hospital settings. Such misuse of alcohol and illicit drugs has a major impact on population health and on costs to health services and to society at large. This review aimed to identify the interventions for alcohol or illicit drug misuse problems that have been evaluated for hospital outpatient populations. APPROACH: Thirteen electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycInfo were searched for published and unpublished studies in any language up to August 2011. Reference lists of included studies and reviews were also hand-searched. We included randomised and controlled clinical trials of any intervention for adult participants identified as having alcohol and/or drug problems presenting to hospital outpatient settings other than addiction or psychiatric units. Participants could be attending hospital for any reason other than treatment for substance abuse. A narrative synthesis was conducted. KEY FINDINGS: There is some evidence to suggest that interventions based on motivational techniques might be effective in treatment of alcohol misuse in oral-maxillofacial clinics but not in general outpatient departments. The evidence is insufficient to allow any conclusions to be derived on the effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of drug misuse and combined alcohol-drug misuse in outpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to investigate interventions for alcohol and drug misuse in outpatient settings. Additionally, problems remain in terms of study quality. Procedures to ensure the rigour of a study were often poorly reported.			2013				3415
Anticoagulant therapies for the prevention of intravascular catheters malfunction in patients undergoing haemodialysis: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials		Wang, A. Y., Ivany, J. N., Perkovic, V., Gallagher, M. P. and Jardine, M. J.				nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the european dialysis and transplant association - european renal association	nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the european dialysis and transplant association - european renal association	BACKGROUND: Catheter malfunction (CM), including thrombosis, is associated with reduced dialysis adequacy, as well as an increased risk of catheter-related bacteraemia (CRB) and mortality. The role of alternative anticoagulant regimens for CM prevention remains uncertain. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed examining all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing interventions acting via an anticoagulant mechanism compared with conventional care for the prevention of CM in adult patients receiving haemodialysis for end-stage kidney disease. Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Register were searched to November 2012. The primary outcome was CM. Secondary outcomes were CRB, all-cause mortality and bleeding events (all bleeding events reported or as defined by authors). Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for individual trials were pooled using random effects models for treatment classes. RESULTS: The search yielded 28 trials including 3081 patients. Therapies assessed were alternative anticoagulant locking solutions (ALSs), systemic warfarin and low/no dose heparin locking solutions (normal saline locks). No significant effect on CM (18 trials, 1579 participants) was observed for alternative ALSs (9 trials, 887 participants, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68-1.07), or low/no dose heparin (4 trials, 231 participants, RR 0.99, CI 0.60-1.62), compared with heparin locking solutions (5000 units). Similarly, no significant effect was observed for warfarin (5 trials, 479 participants, RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.28-1.22) compared with placebo. No significant effect on CRB was observed (15 trials, 2367 participants) for alternative ALSs (11 trials, 2010 participants, RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.30-1.10), warfarin (1 trial, 174 participants, RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.88-6.52) or low/no dose heparin (3 trials, 183 participants, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.35-1.64). All-cause mortality was not affected by alternative ALSs (9 trials, 1719 participants, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.56-1.24) or warfarin (3 trials, 403 participants, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.37-1.65). Bleeding events were only reported in seven trials, including only two trials of warfarin, with no clear effect demonstrated. Within the alternative ALSs group, the only agent with a reduction in CM was recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA)-locking solution (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32-0.86) based on the results of a single trial. Trials were mainly of high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: There is uncertainty on the benefits and harms of anticoagulant therapies over conventional care for prevention of CM. Further high-quality randomized trials, including safety outcomes, are needed.			2013				3249
Effectiveness of psychoeducational support on quality of life in early-stage breast cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials		Matsuda, A., Yamaoka, K., Tango, T., Matsuda, T. and Nishimoto, H.				quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation	quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation	PURPOSE: Most breast cancer patients receive psychosocial support interventions. However, the effectiveness of these interventions has not yet been clarified. Quality of life (QOL) was an important construct that should be considered when assessing these interventions. The purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial and especially psychoeducational support interventions for early-stage breast cancer patients since the follow-up was bound up to 6 months after finishing the intervention. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify randomized controlled trials with early-stage breast cancer patients receiving psychosocial (psychoeducational and other) support in which QOL was measured as a treatment outcome. We compared mean differences at less than 6 months post-intervention with a control group. The primary outcome was Global Health Status/QOL scale (Global QOL), and secondary outcomes were the subscales of QOL. RESULTS: No significant effect was observed for Global QOL; however, individuals receiving psychosocial support scored higher on the Breast Cancer Symptoms subscale. For psychoeducational support in the psychosocial support, significant effect was observed on the Emotional subscale. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis strengthens the evidence of the effectiveness of psychosocial support in improving breast cancer symptoms and psychoeducational support in improving emotional well-being within 6 months post-intervention.			2014				3214
Prenatal folic acid and risk of asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Crider, K. S., Cordero, A. M., Qi, Y. P., Mulinare, J., Dowling, N. F. and Berry, R. J.				the american journal of clinical nutrition	the american journal of clinical nutrition	BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma has become a critical public health problem because of its high morbidity and increasing prevalence. The impact of nutrition and other exposures during pregnancy on long-term health and development of children has been of increasing interest. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association of folate and folic acid intake during pregnancy and risk of asthma and other allergic outcomes in children. DESIGN: We performed a systematic search of 8 electronic databases for articles that examined the association between prenatal folate or folic acid exposure and risk of asthma and other allergic outcomes (eg, allergy, eczema, and atopic dermatitis) in childhood. We performed a meta-analysis by using a random-effects model to derive a summary risk estimate of studies with similar exposure timing, exposure assessment, and outcomes. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis provided no evidence of an association between maternal folic acid supplement use (compared with no use) in the prepregnancy period through the first trimester and asthma in childhood (summary risk estimate: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.30). Because of substantial heterogeneity in exposures and outcomes, it was not possible to generate summary measures for other folate indicators (eg, blood folate concentrations) and asthma or allergy-related outcomes; however, the preponderance of primary risk estimates was not elevated. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support an association between periconceptional folic acid supplementation and increased risk of asthma in children. However, because of the limited number and types of studies in the literature, additional research is needed.			2013				2792
A systematic review of sorafenib in Child-Pugh A patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma		Shen, A., Tang, C., Wang, Y., Chen, Y., Yan, X., Zhang, C., Liu, R., Wei, X., Zhu, Y., Zhang, H. and Wu, Z.				journal of clinical gastroenterology	journal of clinical gastroenterology	BACKGROUND AND GOALS: Several studies have demonstrated that sorafenib is effective in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in Child-Pugh A patients with unresectable HCC. The value of sorafenib treatment in different subgroups was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of the literature published up to July 2012 was conducted. Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched and only randomized controlled trials were included. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials consisting of 1462 patients with unresectable HCC were included. Meta-analyses demonstrated that sorafenib improved the control rate of the disease [relative risk, 1.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.55, 2.20; P<0.001], decreased the risk for tumor progression (hazard ratios, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51, 0.73; P<0.001), and decreased mortality (hazard ratios, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56, 0.89; P<0.001), relative to placebo. Subgroup analyses indicated that sorafenib-based treatments were effective in unresectable HCC regardless of the etiology, performance status, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer-stage, alanine transaminase/asparate transaminase, bilirubin, and ?-feto protein level, except in the subgroup of prior local therapy. Sorafenib was associated with a higher risk of adverse effects than placebo. The risk for grade 3-4 hand-foot skin reactions, rash or desquamation, diarrhea, and hypertension was much higher in the sorafenib treatment group. These side effects could often be mitigated with appropriate treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib was a moderately effective and safe oral drug for use in Child-Pugh A patients with unresectable HCC. Sorafenib monotherapy is not recommended for treating intermediate-stage HCC. More research is needed on the efficacy of sorafenib treatment in patients with prior local therapy.			2013				2995
Renal transplantation and polycystic: surgical considerations		Rodríguez-Faba, O., Breda, A. and Villavicencio, H.				actas urologicas españolas	actas urologicas españolas	BACKGROUND: The indication and timing of nephrectomy in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) remain controversial, especially in patients who are candidates to renal transplantation (RT). The main surgical options such as unilateral vs. bilateral nephrectomy, nephrectomy before vs. after RT, or simultaneous nephrectomy and transplantation, are herein discussed. OBJECTIVE: Evidence acquisition of the best surgical management available for ADPKD in the context of kidney transplantation. ACQUISITION OF EVIDENCE: Systematic literature review in PubMed from 1978 to 2013 was conducted. Articles selected included:randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. Furthermore, well designed ADPKD reviews were considered for this study. SYNTHESIS OF EVIDENCE: Laparoscopic nephrectomy in ADPKD is a safe procedure with an acceptable complication rate. Unilateral nephrectomy has advantages over the bilateral one regarding the perioperative complication rate. Although the timing of nephrectomy is controversial, it seems that simultaneous nephrectomy and renal transplantation does not increase surgical morbidity neither affect graft survival. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous nephrectomy and RT appears to be an acceptable alternative to conventional two-stage procedure without any increased morbidity, in the context of ADPKD. Furthermore, laparoscopic nephrectomy performed in experienced centres is a safe alternative to conventional approach.			2014				3844
Surgical treatment of Zenker's diverticulum		Yuan, Y., Zhao, Y. F., Hu, Y. and Chen, L. Q.				digestive surgery	digestive surgery	BACKGROUND: Different surgical techniques have been indicated for the management of Zenker's diverticulum (ZD), including diverticulectomy, diverticulopexy, and diverticular inversion, with or without myotomy, and myotomy alone. More recently, minimally invasive techniques (such as the transoral endoscopic approach) have become increasingly reliable for this disorder. We therefore conducted this systematic review in order to gain a profound understanding of the current trend and evidence in surgical management of ZD. METHODS: Medline and PubMed were searched to identify studies on surgical intervention of ZD published in English between January 1990 and March 2011. RESULTS: We identified 6,915 patients from 93 studies evaluating the effect of the surgical intervention for ZD. No randomized controlled trials comparing one technique with another were identified. CONCLUSION: Diverticulectomy with myotomy has become the mainstream treatment option for ZD. In certain selected patients, endoscopic diverticulotomy may offer some advantages over open surgery, such as less trauma and a lower complication rate. It is important to individualize optimal therapy for each patient. More randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up results are required to draw a valid conclusion on the best surgical intervention modality for ZD.			2013				3848
A systematic review of interventions for reducing parental vaccine refusal and vaccine hesitancy		Sadaf, A., Richards, J. L., Glanz, J., Salmon, D. A. and Omer, S. B.				vaccine	vaccine	Unvaccinated individuals pose a public health threat to communities. Research has identified many factors associated with parental vaccine refusal and hesitancy toward childhood and adolescent immunizations. However, data on the effectiveness of interventions to address parental refusal are limited. We conducted a systematic review of four online databases to identify interventional studies. We used criteria recommended by the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) for the quality assessment of studies. Intervention categories and outcomes were evaluated for each body of evidence and confidence in overall estimates of effect was determined. There is limited evidence to guide implementation of effective strategies to deal with the emerging threat of parental vaccine refusal. There is a need for appropriately designed, executed and evaluated intervention studies to address this gap in knowledge.			2013				2777
Current concepts and systematic review of vascularized composite allotransplantation of the abdominal wall		Berli, J. U., Broyles, J. M., Lough, D., Shridharani, S. M., Rochlin, D., Cooney, D. S., Lee, W. P., Brandacher, G. and Sacks, J. M.				clinical transplantation	clinical transplantation	INTRODUCTION: Abdominal wall vascularized composite allotransplantation (AW-VCA) is a rarely utilized technique for large composite abdominal wall defects. The goal of this article is to systematically review the literature and current concepts of AW-VCA, outline the challenges ahead, and provide an outlook for the future. METHODS: Systematic review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed to identify relevant articles discussing results of AW-VCA. Cadaver and animal studies were excluded from the systematic review, but selectively included in the discussion. RESULTS: The resultant five papers report their results on AW-VCA(Transplantation, 85, 2008, 1607; Am J Transplant, 7, 2007, 1304; Transplant Proc, 41, 2009, 521; Transplant Proc, 36, 2004, 1561; Lancet, 361, 2003, 2173). These papers represent the result of two study groups in which a total of 18 AW-VCA were performed in 17 patients. Two different operative approaches were used. Overall flap/graft survival was 88%. No mortality related to the transplant was reported. One cadaver study and two animal models were identified and separately presented (Transplant Proc, 43, 2011, 1701; Transplantation, 90, 2010, 1590; Journal of Surgical Research, 162, 2010, 314). CONCLUSION: Literature review reports AW-VCA is technically feasible with low morbidity and mortality. Functional outcomes are not reported and minimally considered. With advancements in vascularized composite allotransplantation research and decreasing toxicity of immunosuppression therapies and immunomodulatory regimens, AW-VCA can be applied in circumstances beyond conjunction with visceral transplantation.			2013				2730
The effectiveness of current dentin desensitizing agents used to treat dental hypersensitivity: A systematic review		da Rosa, W. L., Lund, R. G., Piva, E. and da Silva, A. F.				quintessence international (berlin, germany : 1985)	quintessence international (berlin, germany : 1985)	Objective: Dentin desensitizing agents are used in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity, which is defined as a painful response in the exposed dentin to stimuli that are thermal, evaporative, tactile, osmotic, or chemical. A systematic review was conducted to analyze the clinical effectiveness of current desensitizer with at least 3 months of follow-up. Method and Materials: Eight electronic databases were searched: MedLine (PubMed), Embase, Lilacs, Ibecs, Web of Science, Scopus, Scielo, and The Cochrane Library. Only those clinical trials published from 2000 to 2012 were included. Results: A total of 3,029 relevant records were identified. After title and abstract examination, 2,645 articles were excluded. A data extraction form was designed and completed by reviewers from the selected studies for a retrospective comparison. From the 99 studies retrieved for detailed review, only 17 had an evaluation time of at least 3-months follow-up and fulfilled the selection criteria. Conclusion: Cervitec Plus, SE Bond & Protect Liner F, laser, and iontophoresis have shown satisfactory posttreatment results between 3 and 6 months. However, additional clinical trials are warranted to better compare the different types of treatments and their effectiveness in the longer term.			2013				2839
Corticosteroid Therapy for Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia: A Meta-Analysis		Cheng, M., Pan, Z. Y., Yang, J. and Gao, Y. D.				respiratory care	respiratory care	BACKGROUND: The debate about the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community- acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still a longstanding dilemma. We performed a meta-analysis including 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids on the treatment of severe CAP in adults. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished clinical trials. Databases, including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane (from their establishment to July 2013), were searched for relevant articles. Only RCTs of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in adult patients with severe CAP were selected. RESULTS: Four trials enrolling 264 patients with severe CAP were included. Use of corticosteroids significantly reduced hospital mortality compared with conventional therapy and placebo (Peto odds ratio = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17- 0.90). The quality of the evidence underlying the pooled estimate of effect on hospital mortality was low, downgraded for inconsistency and imprecision. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the current limited evidence, we suggest that, although corticosteroid therapy may reduce mortality and improve the prognosis of adult patients with severe CAP, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the instability of pooled estimates. Reliable treatment recommendations will be raised only when large sufficiently powered multi-center RCTs are conducted.			2014				3916
Alanyl-glutamine Dipeptide for Severe Acute Pancreatitis: A Systematic Review		Wang, Yan-ping, Jiao, Kai, Li, De-bang, Dong, Chun-lu, Wu, Xin-an and Liu, Xiao-ju				???????? (chinese journal of evidence-based medicine)	???????? (chinese journal of evidence-based medicine)	OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the effectiveness and safety of alanyl-glutamine dipeptide for severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: Such databases as MEDLINE, EMbase, CENTRAL, VIP, WanFang Data, CBM and CNKI were electronically searched from inception to October, 2012 for randomized controlled trials on alanyl-glutamine dipeptide for SAP. Two reviewers independently screened literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. Then, meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.2. RESULTS: Five trials were included involving a total of 227 patients. The results of meta-analysis showed that: compared with the control group, the alanyl-glutamine dipeptide group had the lower incidence of SAP complications (RR=0.41, 95%CI 0.20 to 0.82), the lower incidence of infected pancreatic necrosis (RR=0.12, 95%CI 0.02 to 0.89), less time for alleviating bellyache (MD= 0.90, 95%CI 1.72 to 0.08). There was a tendency in decreasing SAP mortality (RR=0.15, 95%CI 0.02 to 1.19) and lessening the recovery time of blood amylase (SMD=0.37, 95%CI 0.04 to 0.79). CONCLUSION: Current evidence shows that, alanyl-glutamine dipeptide can lower the incidence of complications and the incidence of infected pancreatic necrosis, and shorten the time for alleviating bellyache in SAP patients. Due to the limited quality of the included studies, the above conclusion needs to be verified by more high quality studies.			2013				3275
Staphylococcus aureus screening and decolonization in orthopaedic surgery and reduction of surgical site infections		Chen, A. F., Wessel, C. B. and Rao, N.				clinical orthopaedics and related research	clinical orthopaedics and related research	BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism responsible for orthopaedic surgical site infections (SSIs). Patients who are carriers for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) have a higher likelihood of having invasive S. aureus infections. Although some have advocated screening for S. aureus and decolonizing it is unclear whether these efforts reduce SSIs. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purposes of this study were to determine (1) whether S. aureus screening and decolonization reduce SSIs in orthopaedic patients and (2) if implementing this protocol is cost-effective. METHODS: Studies for this systematic review were identified by searching PubMed, which includes MEDLINE (1946-present), EMBASE.com (1974-present), and the Cochrane Library's (John Wiley & Sons) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTAD), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED). Comprehensive literature searches were developed using EMTREE, MeSH, and keywords for each of the search concepts of decolonization, MRSA, and orthopedics/orthopedic surgery. Studies published before 1968 were excluded. We analyzed 19 studies examining the ability of the decolonization protocol to reduce SSIs and 10 studies detailing the cost-effectiveness of S. aureus screening and decolonization. RESULTS: All 19 studies showed a reduction in SSIs or wound complications by instituting a S. aureus screening and decolonization protocol in elective orthopaedic (total joints, spine, and sports) and trauma patients. The S. aureus screening and decolonization protocol also saved costs in orthopaedic patients when comparing the costs of screening and decolonization with the reduction of SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative screening and decolonization of S. aureus in orthopaedic patients is a cost-effective means to reduce SSIs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of Level I-IV studies. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.			2013				3706
Hypothermia for perinatal brain hypoxia-ischemia in different resource settings: a systematic review		Galvao, T. F., Silva, M. T., Marques, M. C., de Oliveira, N. D. and Pereira, M. G.				journal of tropical pediatrics	journal of tropical pediatrics	OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of hypothermia on mortality of neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in different economic resources settings. METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials on MEDLINE, Embase and other databases. Duplicate reviewers selected the studies and extracted data. We calculated meta-analyses of the relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and used meta-regression to evaluate the gross domestic product per capita influence on hypothermia efficacy. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included (n = 1889); eight were conducted in lower income countries (n = 662). Hypothermia significantly reduced mortality (RR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.65-0.92). Meta-regression revealed that hypothermia efficacy does not increase as the gross domestic product per capita rises. CONCLUSIONS: There is enough evidence to support hypothermia as the standard care for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Evidence from low-resource settings is limited, but hypothermia efficacy was not shown to be associated with better resources countries.			2013				3426
A systematic review of the utility of residual vein obstruction studies in primary and secondary venous thrombosis		Janakiram, M., Sullivan, M., Shcherba, M., Guo, S. and Billett, H. H.				thrombosis	thrombosis	Background. Residual vein obstruction (RVO), the persistence of venous thrombosis with time and often after anticoagulation, may indicate a systemic prothrombotic condition. Prior studies have shown varying efficacy in using RVO as a risk factor for future venous thromboembolic (VTE) recurrence. Methods. To assess whether positive RVO imaging predicts recurrent VTE events, we performed a meta-analysis on studies in which patients with documented VTEs, anticoagulated for a minimum of 4 weeks, had repeat sonography to assess RVO and were subsequently followed for recurrent events. Results. Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria: 3531 patient VTE events with 3474 evaluable results were analyzed. The presence of RVO was associated with recurrence in all VTE (OR 1.93; 95% CI: 1.29, 2.89) and secondary VTE (OR 2.78; 95% CI: 1.41, 5.5) but not for primary VTE (OR 1.35; 95% CI: 0.87, 2.08). When cancer patients were eliminated from the secondary VTE group, there was no longer a significant association of RVO with VTE recurrence (OR 1.73; 95% CI: 0.81, 3.67) while in the subset of cancer patients, presence of RVO was associated with an increase in VTE recurrence risk (OR 5.14; 95% CI: 1.59, 16.65, P < 0.006). Conclusions. We conclude that the presence of RVO is associated with recurrence in secondary VTE but not in primary VTE and that association may be driven by the subset with cancer.			2013				3531
Ultrafiltration for acute decompensated heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials		Kwong, J. S. and Yu, C. M.				international journal of cardiology	international journal of cardiology	BACKGROUND: Current clinical guidelines recommend ultrafiltration (UF) for patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) who are unresponsive or resistant to diuretics. We systematically reviewed the latest randomized evidence on the efficacy and safety of UF in ADHF. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane database were searched in January 2013 for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating UF in patients with ADHF. A Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model was used to calculate mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios (ORs) for continuous and dichotomous data, respectively, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Data of 12 studies (n=659) were meta-analyzed; follow-up duration ranged from 36 h to 12 months. Compared to control, treatment of UF was associated with significant fluid removal (MD 1.28, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.12, P=0.003) and weight loss (MD 1.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.44, P=0.04), with no significant effects on all-cause mortality (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.86, P=0.77) or all-cause rehospitalization (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.00, P=0.77). No significant differences were observed in the analyses of change in serum creatinine or unscheduled medical care; analysis of adverse effects was inconclusive since only one study provided usable data. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with ADHF, UF is effective in reducing fluid retention and body weight, with no significant benefits in mortality or rehospitalization. The current limited randomized evidence highlights the need for further well-conducted randomized studies of adequate power to establish the role of UF in ADHF patients for whom conventional HF treatment is unsuccessful or contraindicated.			2014				3388
Effectiveness and safety of pemetrexed versus docetaxel as a treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Di, B. S., Wei, K. P., Tian, J. H., Xiao, X. J., Li, Y., Zhang, X. H., Yu, Q., Yang, K. H., Ge, L., Huang, W. H. and Zhang, F. W.				asian pacific journal of cancer prevention : apjcp	asian pacific journal of cancer prevention : apjcp	BACKGROUND: Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed and docetaxel for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, China Biology Medicine Database for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy and toxicities of pemetrexed versus docetaxel as a treatment for advanced NSCLC. We limited the languages to English and Chinese. Two reviewers independently screened articles to identify eligible trials according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and assessed the methodological quality of included trials, and then extracted data. The meta-analysis was performed using STATA12.0. RESULTS: Six RCTs involving 1,414 patients were identified. We found that there was no statistically significant differences in overall response rate, survival time, progression-free survival, disease control rate, and 1-2 yr survival rate (p>0.050) but it is worthy of mention that patients in the pemetrexed arms had significantly higher 3-yr survival rate (P=0.002). With regard to the grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity, compared with docetaxel, pemetrexed led to lower rate of grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, and leukocyts toxicity (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in anemia between the two arms (p=0.08). In addition, pemetrexed led to higher rate of grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia toxicity (p=0.03). As for the non-hematological toxicities, compared with docetaxel, pemetrexed group had lower rate of grade 3-4 diarrhea and alopecia. CONCLUSIONS: Pemetrexed was almost as effective as docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC. At the same time, pemetrexed might increase the 3-yr survival rate. As for safety, pemetrexed led to lower rate of grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, leukocytes, diarrhea and alopecia toxicity. However, it was associated with a higher rate of grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia.			2014				3625
Economic evaluations of trastuzumab in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: a systematic review and critique		Parkinson, B., Pearson, S. A. and Viney, R.				the european journal of health economics : hepac : health economics in prevention and care	the european journal of health economics : hepac : health economics in prevention and care	BACKGROUND: Published economic evaluations of trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer have arrived at different conclusions regarding the cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab, despite comparative efficacy being demonstrated by a small set of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). OBJECTIVES: This article aims to provide insight into the quality of the evaluations and explore the possible drivers of the conflicting conclusions. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify all published economic evaluations that compared the incremental costs and outcomes of trastuzumab versus a comparator. RESULTS: Fifteen economic evaluations were identified. In the evaluations that estimated efficacy using an RCT, the key drivers of the conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness were: the approach used to estimate overall survival in the control group given crossover to trastuzumab following progression in the trials; the inclusion of treatment beyond progression; inclusion of wastage due to unused vial portions, adverse events, and the cost of HER2 testing. Four evaluations used non-randomised approaches to estimate efficacy, thus introducing the potential for confounding. As a result these evaluations reported relatively optimistic estimates of comparative effectiveness. Finally the evaluations used different thresholds to determine whether treatment with trastuzumab was cost-effective. CONCLUSION: There were numerous drivers of the different conclusions regarding the cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab, many of which are due to judgements made by the authors when translating data from RCTs. Many of the potential drivers were not identified by the published systematic reviews of economic evaluations and perhaps more remain unidentified because of inconsistent and limited reporting.			2014				2796
Comparative effectiveness of long term drug treatment strategies to prevent asthma exacerbations: network meta-analysis		Loymans, R. J., Gemperli, A., Cohen, J., Rubinstein, S. M., Sterk, P. J., Reddel, H. K., Jüni, P. and Ter Riet, G.				bmj (clinical research ed.)	bmj (clinical research ed.)	OBJECTIVE: To determine the comparative effectiveness and safety of current maintenance strategies in preventing exacerbations of asthma. DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis using Bayesian statistics. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane systematic reviews on chronic asthma, complemented by an updated search when appropriate. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA TRIALS OF Adults with asthma randomised to maintenance treatments of at least 24 weeks duration and that reported on asthma exacerbations in full text. Low dose inhaled corticosteroid treatment was the comparator strategy. The primary effectiveness outcome was the rate of severe exacerbations. The secondary outcome was the composite of moderate or severe exacerbations. The rate of withdrawal was analysed as a safety outcome. RESULTS: 64 trials with 59,622 patient years of follow-up comparing 15 strategies and placebo were included. For prevention of severe exacerbations, combined inhaled corticosteroids and long acting ? agonists as maintenance and reliever treatment and combined inhaled corticosteroids and long acting ? agonists in a fixed daily dose performed equally well and were ranked first for effectiveness. The rate ratios compared with low dose inhaled corticosteroids were 0.44 (95% credible interval 0.29 to 0.66) and 0.51 (0.35 to 0.77), respectively. Other combined strategies were not superior to inhaled corticosteroids and all single drug treatments were inferior to single low dose inhaled corticosteroids. Safety was best for conventional best (guideline based) practice and combined maintenance and reliever therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies with combined inhaled corticosteroids and long acting ? agonists are most effective and safe in preventing severe exacerbations of asthma, although some heterogeneity was observed in this network meta-analysis of full text reports.			2014				3805
Prolapse surgery with or without stress incontinence surgery for pelvic organ prolapse: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials		van der Ploeg, J., van der Steen, A., Rengerink, K., van der Vaart, C. and Roovers, J.				bjog : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology	bjog : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology	OBJECTIVES: The combination of prolapse surgery with an incontinence procedure can reduce the incidence of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) after surgery, but may increase adverse events. We compared the effectiveness and safety of prolapse surgery versus combined prolapse and incontinence surgery in women with pelvic organ prolapse. DESIGN AND SETTING: Pubmed, EMBASE, DARE, the Cochrane Library and the register of Current Controlled Trials were searched for randomised trials (restricted to Burch colposuspension and midurethral sling as incontinence procedure) from 1995 to 2013 limited to the English literature. METHODS: Two reviewers selected eligible articles and extracted the data. Pooling for SUI was based on three patient groups: (1) women with coexisting SUI; (2) women asymptomatic for SUI; and (3) women with occult SUI. For adverse events, pooling was based on incontinence procedure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was SUI. The secondary outcomes were treatment for SUI, bladder storage symptoms, obstructive voiding and adverse events. RESULTS: Seven trials were included. Pooling for women with coexisting SUI was possible for objective SUI with two studies and showed no difference. Statistical (I(2) = 95%) and clinical heterogeneity was, however, high. The largest study showed a lower incidence of persisting SUI (5% versus 23%) and treatment for this (0% versus 57%) in women who underwent prolapse repair with a midurethral sling. The second study did not find a difference in women undergoing a sacrocolpopexy with or without Burch colposuspension. In asymptomatic women, combination surgery resulted in a lower incidence of de novo subjective SUI (two studies; 24% versus 41%; relative risk [RR], 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-0.9; I(2) = 36%) and the need for subsequent anti-incontinence surgery (three studies; 2% versus 7%; RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8; I(2) = 13%). For the outcome objective SUI, pooling was possible for five studies, but statistical heterogeneity was high (I(2) = 82%) and the difference was not statistically significant. In the subgroup of women with occult stress incontinence, we found a lower incidence of objective SUI after combination surgery (two studies; 22% versus 52%; RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8; I(2) = 32%). There were no differences in bladder storage symptoms, urgency incontinence or long-term obstructive voiding symptoms. Adverse events (two studies; 15% versus 10%; RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.5; I(2) = 0%) and prolonged catheterisation (three studies; 6% versus 1%; RR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.5-13.3; I(2) = 0%) were more frequent after vaginal prolapse repair with a midurethral sling. CONCLUSIONS: Combination surgery reduces the risk of postoperative stress incontinence, but short-term voiding difficulties and adverse events were more frequent after combination surgery with a midurethral sling.			2014				3598
Cognitive and behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in psychiatric populations: A systematic review		Taylor, D. J. and Pruiksma, K. E.				international review of psychiatry (abingdon, england)	international review of psychiatry (abingdon, england)	Insomnia is highly co-morbid with psychiatric disorders, making it a frequent issue in treatment planning in psychiatric clinics. Research has also shown that although insomnia may originally precede or be a consequence of a psychiatric disorder, insomnia likely becomes semi-independent, and may exacerbate those disorders if it is not addressed, leading to reduced treatment response. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is now recommended as the first line of treatment of primary insomnia. The research reviewed below indicates that CBT-I in patients with co-morbid depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse disorders is generally effective for insomnia and sometimes the co-morbid disorder as well. Although more research is needed before definitive recommendations can be made, it appears as though CBT-I is a viable approach to treating the patient with co-morbid insomnia and psychiatric disorders.			2014				3417
A review of halotherapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease		Rashleigh, R., Smith, S. M. and Roberts, N. J.				international journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	international journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, progressive disease and is treated with inhaled medication to optimize the patient's lung health through decreasing their symptoms, especially breathlessness. Halotherapy is the inhalation of micronized dry salt within a chamber that mimics a salt cave environment. Recent media reports suggest that this therapy may help with the symptoms of COPD. OBJECTIVE: To critically evaluate and summarize the evidence for the use of halotherapy as a treatment for COPD. DESIGN: A review using systematic approach and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Google Scholar were searched. Two reviewers independently reviewed abstracts and selected eligible studies based on predetermined selection criteria. RESULTS: Of the 151 articles retrieved from databases and relevant reference lists, only one randomized controlled trial met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis was unable to be conducted due to the limited number of published studies. Inclusion criteria were subsequently expanded to allow three case-control studies to be included, ensuring that a narrative synthesis could be completed. From the pooled data of the four studies, there were 1,041 participants (661 in the intervention group and 380 in the control group). The assessment of methodological quality raised issues associated with randomization and patient selection. Three themes were identified from the narrative synthesis: respiratory function, quality of life, and medication use. CONCLUSION: Themes generated from the narrative synthesis data reflect outcome measures regularly used for interventional research associated with COPD. From this review, recommendations for inclusion of halotherapy as a therapy for COPD cannot be made at this point and there is a need for high quality studies to determine the effectiveness of this therapy.			2014				3829
Stem cell therapy for the treatment of nonischemic cardiomyopathy: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials		Marquis-Gravel, G., Stevens, L. M., Mansour, S., Avram, R. and Noiseux, N.				the canadian journal of cardiology	the canadian journal of cardiology	BACKGROUND: Stem cell (SC) therapy improves left ventricular function and dimensions in ischemic heart disease. Few small-scale trials have studied the effects of SC therapy on nonischemic cardiomyopathy (CMP), the leading cause of heart transplantation in the adults. The objectives were to gain a better insight into the effects of SC therapy for nonischemic CMP by conducting a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: Medline, EBM Reviews-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and the ClinicalTrials.gov databases were screened for randomized controlled trials involving SC for treatment of nonischemic CMP. Weighted mean differences of improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) were calculated using a random effect analysis model. RESULTS: Four trials were included in this meta-analysis (244 patients). The weighted mean LVEF improvement was 4.87% (95% confidence interval, 1.32-8.43%) in the treatment group compared with the control group (P = 0.01). The weighted mean decrease of LVEDD in the treatment group was of -2.19 mm (95% confidence interval, -5.69 to 1.30) compared with the control group (P = 0.22). On subgroup analysis, results were similar in studies involving peripheral CD34-positive or bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (P = 0.33 for subgroup differences). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first meta-analysis to show that for the treatment of nonischemic CMP, SC therapy might improve LVEF, but not LVEDD. Further trials should aim to circumscribe the optimal SC regimen in this setting, and to assess long-term clinical outcomes as primary end points.			2014				3230
Assessing the impact of drinking water and sanitation on diarrhoeal disease in low- and middle-income settings: systematic review and meta-regression		Wolf, J., Prüss-Ustün, A., Cumming, O., Bartram, J., Bonjour, S., Cairncross, S., Clasen, T., Colford, J. M., Curtis, V., De France, J., Fewtrell, L., Freeman, M. C., Gordon, B., Hunter, P. R., Jeandron, A., Johnston, R. B., Mäusezahl, D., Mathers, C., Neira, M. and Higgins, J. P.				tropical medicine & international health : tm & ih	tropical medicine & international health : tm & ih	OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of inadequate water and sanitation on diarrhoeal disease in low- and middle-income settings. METHODS: The search strategy used Cochrane Library, MEDLINE & PubMed, Global Health, Embase and BIOSIS supplemented by screening of reference lists from previously published systematic reviews, to identify studies reporting on interventions examining the effect of drinking water and sanitation improvements in low- and middle-income settings published between 1970 and May 2013. Studies including randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised trials with control group, observational studies using matching techniques and observational studies with a control group where the intervention was well defined were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified Ottawa-Newcastle scale. Study results were combined using meta-analysis and meta-regression to derive overall and intervention-specific risk estimates. RESULTS: Of 6819 records identified for drinking water, 61 studies met the inclusion criteria, and of 12,515 records identified for sanitation, 11 studies were included. Overall, improvements in drinking water and sanitation were associated with decreased risks of diarrhoea. Specific improvements, such as the use of water filters, provision of high-quality piped water and sewer connections, were associated with greater reductions in diarrhoea compared with other interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that inadequate water and sanitation are associated with considerable risks of diarrhoeal disease and that there are notable differences in illness reduction according to the type of improved water and sanitation implemented.			2014				3580
Extended-release opioids in the management of cancer pain: A systematic review of efficacy and safety		Mesgarpour, B., Griebler, U., Glechner, A., Kien, C., Strobelberger, M., Van Noord, M. G. and Michalek-Sauberer, A.				european journal of pain (london, england)	european journal of pain (london, england)	Despite the increased availability of strong analgesics and evidence-based recommendations for pain management, under-treatment of cancer-related pain is still common. Extended-release (ER) opioids, in contrast to immediate-release opioids, provide prolonged analgesia. In this review, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of ER opioid analgesics in managing moderate-to-severe pain in patients with cancer. We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled observational studies that compared ER opioids in cancer pain by searching several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Two independent reviewers screened and evaluated retrieved records to select relevant studies. We dually assessed the risk of bias for included studies and evaluated the overall strength of evidence for six critical outcomes using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation level of evidence. A total of three double-blind RCTs (comparative efficacy and adverse events), two non-blinded RCTs and four observational studies (comparative adverse events) were included in this review. All randomized trials and one observational study were of high risk of bias, and three observational studies of unclear risk of bias. The level of evidence for the selected efficacy and safety outcomes was low and very low. We synthesized the findings qualitatively because of the paucity of relevant studies as well as variable study design and quality. This systematic review indicates no substantial differences in efficacy and frequent adverse events among ER opioids for cancer pain. The body of evidence, however, is limited to few comparisons and fraught with methodological shortcomings.			2014				2773
The Efficacy of Hypnotherapy in the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Lee, H. H., Choi, Y. Y. and Choi, M. G.				journal of neurogastroenterology and motility	journal of neurogastroenterology and motility	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hypnotherapy is considered as a promising intervention for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but the evidence is still limited. The aims of this study were to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the efficacy of hypnotherapy for the treatment of IBS. METHODS: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL database). Only randomized controlled trials that compared hypnotherapy with any other conven-tional treatment or no treatment in patients with IBS were included. Studies had to report outcomes as IBS symptom score or quality of life. The mean change in outcome score was used to pool these outcomes for the meta-analysis. Data were syn-thesized using the standardized mean difference for continuous data. RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials (6 papers) involving 374 patients with IBS were identified. Performance bias was high in all trials because it was impossible to blind participants and therapists in this type of intervention. The outcomes in this meta-anal-ysis were evaluated at 3 months for short-term effects and at 1 year for long-term effects. The change in abdominal pain score at 3 months was significant in the hypnotherapy group (standardized mean difference, -0.83; 95% CI, -1.65 to -0.01). Three of the 4 trials showed greater improvement in overall gastrointestinal symptoms in the hypnotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides clearer evidence that hypnotherapy has beneficial short-term effects in improving gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with IBS.			2014				2904
The Efficacy of Selected Desensitizing OTC Products: A Systematic Review		Talioti, E., Hill, R. and Gillam, D. G.				isrn dentistry	isrn dentistry	Objectives. The aim of the present study was to review the published literature in order to identify relevant studies for inclusion and to determine whether there was any evidence on the clinical effectiveness of selected desensitizing toothpastes, calcium sodium phosphosilicate (CSPS), amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), nanohydroxyapatite, and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (tooth mousse) on reducing dentine hypersensitivity (DH). Materials and Methods. Following a review of 593 papers identified from searching both electronic databases (PUBMED) and hand searching of relevant written journals, only 5 papers were accepted for inclusion. Results. Analysis of the included studies (3 CSPS and 2 ACP) would suggest that there may be some benefit for patients using these products for reducing DH. No direct comparative studies were available to assess all these products under the same conditions neither were there any comparative randomised controlled studies that compared at least two of these products in determining their effectiveness in treating DH. Conclusions. Due to the small number of included studies, there are limited clinical data to support any claims of clinical efficacy of these OTC products. Further studies are therefore required to determine the efficacy of these products in well-controlled RCT studies with a larger sample size.			2014				3301
Comparisons between novel oral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonists in patients with CKD		Harel, Z., Sholzberg, M., Shah, P. S., Pavenski, K., Harel, S., Wald, R., Bell, C. M. and Perl, J.				journal of the american society of nephrology : jasn	journal of the american society of nephrology : jasn	Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban) have been approved by international regulatory agencies to treat atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism in patients with kidney dysfunction. However, altered metabolism of these drugs in the setting of impaired kidney function may subject patients with CKD to alterations in their efficacy and a higher risk of bleeding. This article examined the efficacy and safety of the NOACs versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism in patients with CKD. A systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were conducted to estimate relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CIs) using a random-effects model. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify articles published up to March 2013. We selected published randomized controlled trials of NOACs compared with VKAs of at least 4 weeks' duration that enrolled patients with CKD (defined as creatinine clearance of 30-50 ml/min) and reported data on comparative efficacy and bleeding events. Eight randomized controlled trials were eligible. There was no significant difference in the primary efficacy outcomes of stroke and systemic thromboembolism (four trials, 9693 participants; RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.39 to 1.04]) and recurrent thromboembolism or thromboembolism-related death (four trials, 891 participants; RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.43 to 2.15]) with NOACs versus VKAs. The risk of major bleeding or the combined endpoint of major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (primary safety outcome) (eight trials, 10,616 participants; RR 0.89 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.16]) was similar between the groups. The use of NOACs in select patients with CKD demonstrates efficacy and safety similar to those with VKAs. Proactive postmarketing surveillance and further studies are pivotal to further define the rational use of these agents.			2014				4016
Weighing the evidence of low glycemic index dietary intervention for the management of gestational diabetes mellitus: an Asian perspective		Mohd Yusof, B. N., Firouzi, S., Mohd Shariff, Z., Mustafa, N., Mohamed Ismail, N. A. and Kamaruddin, N. A.				international journal of food sciences and nutrition	international journal of food sciences and nutrition	This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of low glycemic index (GI) dietary intervention for the treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), specifically from the Asian perspective. A systematic review of the literature using multiple databases without time restriction was conducted. Three studies were retrieved based upon a priori inclusion criteria. While there was a trend towards improvement, no significant differences were observed in overall glycemic control and pregnancy outcomes in GDM women. However, a tendency for lower birth weight and birth centile if the intervention began earlier was noted. Low GI diets were well accepted and had identical macro-micronutrient compositions as the control diets. However, due to genetic, environment and especially food pattern discrepancies between Western countries and Asians, these results may not be contributed to Asian context. Clearly, there are limited studies focusing on the effect of low GI dietary intervention in women with GDM, particularly in Asia.			2014				3694
Early versus late initiation of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Liu, Y., Davari-Farid, S., Arora, P., Porhomayon, J. and Nader, N. D.				journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia	journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of early versus late renal replacement therapy (RRT) on mortality in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of 9 retrospective cohort studies and 2 randomized clinical trials extracted from the Medline engine from 1950 to 2013. SETTING: University medical school. PARTICIPANTS: 841 Patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 841 patients were studied. Pooled estimates of the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval using a random-effect model were conducted as well as the heterogeneity, publication bias, and sensitivity analysis. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcome was the intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. The 28-days mortality rate was lower in the early RRT group (OR = 0.29, 95% CI, 0.16-0.52, p<0.0001, NNT = 5). Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 56%), and publication bias was low. Secondary outcome suggested 3.9 (1.5-6.3) days shorter ICU stay in the early RRT group, p<0.0001, with extremely high heterogeneity (I(2) = 99%), and low publication bias. Specifically, studies before 2000 and studies with mortality less than 50% in the late RRT group reported significantly higher odds ratio and mean difference than overall value favoring early RRT. CONCLUSION: Early initiation of RRT for patients with AKI after cardiac surgery revealed lower 28-days mortality and shorter ICU length of stay. However, this was based on 11 studies of various qualities with very high heterogeneity of results. Defining treatment guidelines needs further research with a larger and better database.			2014				3626
Dose Efficiency of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents for the Treatment of Patients With Chemotherapy-Induced Anemia: A Systematic Review		Forbes, C. A., Worthy, G., Harker, J., Kleijnen, J., Kutikova, L., Zelek, L. and Van Belle, S.				clinical therapeutics	clinical therapeutics	BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) increase red blood cell production in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA). In Europe, short-acting ESAs (epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin zeta, and epoetin theta) and a long-acting ESA (darbepoetin alfa) are available to treat CIA. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to determine potential dose efficiency associated with the use of different ESAs for the treatment of CIA according to European labeling. METHODS: A systematic review of ESA studies with starting doses according to European labeling was conducted according to published methodology. Measures of dose efficiency were defined as mean weekly doses to achieve target hemoglobin level or final dose and dose adjustments (dose increase, decrease, or withheld). Electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched up to July 2012. Data were selected for analysis using an evidence hierarchy and quantitatively analyzed to assess statistical homogeneity. Where pooling of data was not appropriate, a narrative summary with descriptive statistics (medians and ranges) was reported. RESULTS: Fifty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-five studies considered to represent the highest level of evidence were extracted and included in the analysis. The analysis showed a high degree of statistical heterogeneity, often precluding meta-analysis. The patients included in the analysis were representative of those encountered in clinical practice, and patient characteristics were similar between the short-acting and the darbepoetin alfa groups. Mean weekly doses appeared ~30% lower with darbepoetin alfa versus short-acting ESAs (median, 136.5 ?g or 27,300 IU [range, 21,560-38,260 IU] vs 38,230 IU [range, 31,634-42,714 IU], respectively), resulting in a mean weekly dose ratio of 1:280. Darbepoetin alfa patients appeared to need fewer dose increases compared with short-acting ESAs (pooled, 0.75%; I(2) = 21% vs median 26.6% [range, 7.6%-44.6%]) and more dose decreases (median, 74% [range, 57%-75%] vs 22% [range, 2.8%-59%]). A similar percentage of darbepoetin alfa and short-acting ESA patients required a dose to be withheld (20% and 33% [2 studies] vs median 33.2% [range, 12.6%-51.1%]). CONCLUSIONS: Statistical heterogeneity between studies was high, although clinically the studies represented medical practice. Without randomized clinical trials directly comparing darbepoetin alfa and short-acting ESAs, these findings are tentative and future research is warranted. This review shows that good-quality, reliable data from head-to-head trials are lacking. The best available evidence comes from prospective ESA-arm data. Mean weekly doses, dose increases, and dose decreases suggest a dose efficiency for darbepoetin alfa compared with short-acting ESAs.			2014				2847
Psychological benefits of weight loss following behavioural and/or dietary weight loss interventions. A systematic research review		Lasikiewicz, N., Myrissa, K., Hoyland, A. and Lawton, C. L.				appetite	appetite	It is generally accepted that weight loss has significant physiological benefits, such as reduced risk of diabetes, lowered blood pressure and blood lipid levels. However, few behavioural and dietary interventions have investigated psychological benefit as the primary outcome. Hence, systematic review methodology was adopted to evaluate the psychological outcomes of weight loss following participation in a behavioural and/or dietary weight loss intervention in overweight/obese populations. 36 Studies were selected for inclusion and were reviewed. Changes in self-esteem, depressive symptoms, body image and health related quality of life (HRQoL) were evaluated and discussed. Where possible, effect sizes to indicate the magnitude of change pre- to post- intervention were calculated using Hedges' g standardised mean difference. The results demonstrated consistent improvements in psychological outcomes concurrent with and sometimes without weight loss. Improvements in body image and HRQoL (especially vitality) were closely related to changes in weight. Calculated effect sizes varied considerably and reflected the heterogeneous nature of the studies included in the review. Although the quality of the studies reviewed was generally acceptable, only 9 out of 36 studies included a suitable control/comparison group and the content, duration of intervention and measures used to assess psychological outcomes varied considerably. Further research is required to improve the quality of studies assessing the benefits of weight loss to fully elucidate the relationship between weight loss and psychological outcomes.			2014				3074
?-Lactam/macrolide dual therapy versus ?-lactam monotherapy for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Nie, W., Li, B. and Xiu, Q.				the journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy	the journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy	OBJECTIVES: Several studies have compared the clinical effect of ?-lactam/macrolide (BLM) dual therapy versus ?-lactam (BL) monotherapy in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients. However, the results remain controversial. Thus, we did this meta-analysis to determine which treatment was more effective. METHODS: Databases comprising PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched to find relevant studies. The primary outcome was mortality. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies. Multivariable-adjusted ORs with 95% CIs were pooled in the random effects model. RESULTS: Four prospective cohort studies and 12 retrospective cohort studies were included (n?=?42?942). Compared with BL monotherapy, BLM dual therapy was significantly associated with reduced mortality (adjusted OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.61-0.73, P?<?0.001, I(2)?=?3%). Subsequent subgroup analyses confirmed that BLM dual therapy was statistically superior to BL monotherapy in reduction of mortality. Sensitivity analyses strengthened the validity of the results. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with BL monotherapy, BLM dual therapy might reduce mortality risk in patients with CAP. Because this finding is based on observational studies, randomized controlled trials are required to demonstrate the usefulness of BLM dual therapy in the treatment of CAP.			2014				3581
Efficacy and safety of infliximab-biosimilar compared to other biological drugs in rheumatoid arthritis: a mixed treatment comparison		Baji, P., Péntek, M., Czirják, L., Szekanecz, Z., Nagy, G., Gulácsi, L. and Brodszky, V.				the european journal of health economics : hepac : health economics in prevention and care	the european journal of health economics : hepac : health economics in prevention and care	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab-biosimilar and other available biologicals for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), namely abatacept, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab and tocilizumab. METHODS: A systematic literature review of MEDLINE database until August 2013 was carried out to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Bayesian mixed treatment comparison method was applied for the pairwise comparison of treatments. Improvement rates by the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20 and ACR50) at week 24 were used as efficacy endpoints, and the occurrence of serious adverse events was considered to assess the safety of the biologicals. RESULTS: Thirty-six RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. All the biological agents proved to be superior to placebo. For ACR20 response, certolizumab pegol showed the highest odds ratio (OR) compared to placebo, OR 7.69 [95% CI 3.69-14.26], followed by abatacept OR 3.7 [95% CI 2.17-6.06], tocilizumab OR 3.69 [95% CI 1.87-6.62] and infliximab-biosimilar OR 3.47 [95% CI 0.85-9.7]. For ACR50 response, certolizumab pegol showed the highest OR compared to placebo OR 8.46 [3.74-16.82], followed by tocilizumab OR 5.57 [95% CI 2.77-10.09], and infliximab-biosimilar OR 4.06 [95% CI 1.01-11.54]. Regarding the occurrence of serious adverse events, the results show no statistically significant difference between infliximab-biosimilar and placebo, OR 1.87 [95% CI 0.74-3.84]. No significant difference regarding efficacy and safety was found between infliximab-biosimilar and the other biological treatments. CONCLUSION: This is the first indirect meta-analysis in RA that compares the efficacy and safety of biosimilar-infliximab to the other biologicals indicated in RA. We found no significant difference between infliximab-biosimilar and other biological agents in terms of clinical efficacy and safety.			2014				4034
Rash to the mTOR inhibitor everolimus: systematic review and meta-analysis		Ramirez-Fort, M. K., Case, E. C., Rosen, A. C., Cerci, F. B., Wu, S. and Lacouture, M. E.				american journal of clinical oncology	american journal of clinical oncology	"BACKGROUND: Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor approved for treatment of renal cell carcinoma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, breast cancer, and progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin. Its use may be hindered because of adverse events, including rash. The reported incidence and risk of a rash to everolimus varies widely and has not been closely investigated. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the incidence and risk of developing a rash. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases and abstracts presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology from 1998 to December 2011 using the keyword ""everolimus"" to identify relevant clinical trials. Eligible studies included prospective phase II and III clinical trials of cancer patients on 10 mg of everolimus daily with available data on incidence of rash. The summary incidence and relative risk (RR) of rash were calculated using either the random-effects or fixed-effects model, depending on the heterogeneity of the constituent studies. RESULTS: A total of 2242 patients with various malignancies from 13 clinical trials were included in the analysis. The summary incidences of all-grade and high-grade rash in patients on everolimus were 28.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 20.8-38.0] and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.6-1.8), respectively. Everolimus was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of all-grade rash (RR=3.853, 95% CI, 2.470-6.013, P=0.000), but the RR for high-grade rash (RR=2.997, 95% CI, 0.633-14.185) was not statistically significant, with a P value of 0.166. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus is associated with a significant risk of developing a rash. Management of rash to everolimus is critical to prevent dose modifications and decreased quality of life, both of which can negatively affect overall clinical outcomes."			2014				2709
Prophylactic magnesium sulfate for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Reddy, D., Fallah, A., Petropoulos, J. A., Farrokhyar, F., Macdonald, R. L. and Jichici, D.				neurocritical care	neurocritical care	Delayed cerebral ischemia following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality. Magnesium sulfate has been proposed as a prophylactic intervention for angiographic vasospasm and to improve clinical outcomes. A systematic review was conducted to determine the evidence for the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, clinicaltrials.gov, and controlled-trials.com were searched with a comprehensive search strategy. 2,035 records were identified in the initial search and 1,574 remained after removal of duplicates. Randomized, parallel group, controlled trials of magnesium sulfate in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were included. A total of ten studies were included. Review Manager and GRADE software were used to synthesize the results. The summary effect for Glasgow outcome scale and the modified Rankin scale is a risk ratio (RR) of 0.93 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.82-1.06]. The RR for mortality is 0.95 [95 % CI 0.76-1.17]. Delayed cerebral ischemia has a RR of 0.54 [95 % CI 0.38-0.75], which is the only outcome with a statistically significant summary effect measure favoring magnesium treatment. Delayed ischemic neurological deficit has a RR of 0.93 [95 % CI 0.62-1.39]. Transcranial doppler vasospasm has a RR of 0.72 [95 % CI 0.51-1.03]. Current evidence does not support the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.			2014				2836
Collaborative care for comorbid depression and diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Atlantis, E., Fahey, P. and Foster, J.				bmj open	bmj open	OBJECTIVE: The collaborative care model is recommended for depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem like diabetes. We sought to systematically assess the effect of collaborative care on depression and glycaemia in adults with comorbid depression and diabetes to inform guidelines and practice. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Health Source Nursing, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and reference lists of retrieved articles published before August 2013. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on collaborative care (ie, coordinated multidisciplinary model of care) for depression that reported the effects on depression and glycaemic outcomes in adults with comorbid clinically relevant depression and diabetes were eligible. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Data on the mean difference in depression and glycaemic outcomes were extracted and pooled using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Seven RCTs included for review reported effects on depression outcomes in 1895 participants, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level in 1556 participants. Collaborative care significantly improved the depression score (standardised mean difference was -0.32 (95% CI -0.53 to -0.11); I(2)=79%) and HbA1c level (weighted mean difference was -0.33% (95% CI -0.66% to -0.00%); I(2)=72.9%) compared with control conditions. Depression remission did not predict better glycaemic control across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence from short-to-medium term RCTs predominantly conducted in the USA suggests that collaborative care for depression significantly improves both depression and glycaemia outcomes, independently, in people with comorbid depression and diabetes.			2014				2822
Are Work Disability Prevention Interventions Effective for the Management of Neck Pain or Upper Extremity Disorders? A Systematic Review by the Ontario Protocol for Traffic Injury Management (OPTIMa) Collaboration		Varatharajan, S., Côté, P., Shearer, H. M., Loisel, P., Wong, J. J., Southerst, D., Yu, H., Randhawa, K., Sutton, D., van der Velde, G., Mior, S., Carroll, L. J., Jacobs, C. and Taylor-Vaisey, A.				journal of occupational rehabilitation	journal of occupational rehabilitation	Purpose We conducted a systematic review to critically appraise and synthesize literature on the effectiveness of work disability prevention (WDP) interventions in workers with neck pain, whiplash-associated disorders (WAD), or upper extremity disorders. Methods We searched electronic databases from 1990 to 2012. Random pairs of independent reviewers critically appraised eligible studies using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. Scientifically admissible studies were summarized and synthesized following best-evidence synthesis methodology. Results Of the 6,359 articles retrieved, 16 randomized controlled trials were eligible for critical appraisal and five were admissible. We found that a return-to-work coordination program (including workplace-based work hardening) was superior to clinic-based work hardening for persistent rotator cuff tendinitis. Workplace high-intensity strength training and workplace advice had similar outcomes for neck and shoulder pain. Mensendieck/Cesar postural exercises and strength and fitness exercises had similar outcomes for non-specific work-related upper limb complaints. Adding a brief job stress education program to a workplace ergonomic intervention was not beneficial for persistent upper extremity symptoms. Adding computer-prompted work breaks to ergonomic adjustments and workplace education benefited workers' recovery from recent work-related neck and upper extremity complaints. Conclusions At present, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of WDP interventions for managing neck pain, WAD, and upper extremity disorders. Our review suggests a return-to-work coordination program is more effective than clinic-based work hardening. Also, adding computer-prompted breaks to ergonomic and workplace interventions benefits workers' recovery. The current quality of evidence does not allow for a definitive evaluation of the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions.			2014				3258
Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: a systematic review		Anglemyer, A., Rutherford, G. W., Easterbrook, P. J., Horvath, T., Vitória, M., Jan, M. and Doherty, M. C.				aids (london, england)	aids (london, england)	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to update evidence on when to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) to inform revision of the 2013 WHO guidelines for ART in low and middle-income countries. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We comprehensively searchescohorts. Outcomes were mortality, clinical progression, virologic failure, immunologic recover, and severe adverse events. We pooled data across studies and estimated summary effect sizes. We graded the quality of evidence from the literature for each outcome. RESULTS: We identified 24 studies; 3 were RCTs. Studies found reduced risk of mortality [1 RCT.: hazard ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-1.76; 13 cohorts: relative risk (RR) 0.66, 95% CI 0.55-0.79], progression to AIDS or death (2 RCTs: RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26-0.91; 9 cohorts: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.40-1.24) and diagnosis of a non-AIDS-defining illness (1 RCT.: RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.64; 1 cohort: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.98), and an increased risk of grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities in patients initiating ART at at least 350 cells/?l (1 RCT.: RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.25-1.77). The quality of evidence was low or very low for clinical outcomes due to few events and imprecision, and high for adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contributed to the evidence base for the revised 2013 WHO guidelines on ART, which recommend initiating ART at CD4 T-cell counts of 350-500 cells/?l, but not above 500 cells/?l compared to initiating it later when CD4 T-cell counts fall below 350 cells/?l.			2014				2880
The effectiveness of electronic screening and brief intervention for reducing levels of alcohol consumption: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Donoghue, K., Patton, R., Phillips, T., Deluca, P. and Drummond, C.				journal of medical internet research	journal of medical internet research	BACKGROUND: Electronic screening and brief intervention (eSBI) has been shown to reduce alcohol consumption, but its effectiveness over time has not been subject to meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to determine the effectiveness of eSBI over time in nontreatment-seeking hazardous/harmful drinkers. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies identified through searching the electronic databases PsychINFO, Medline, and EMBASE in May 2013. Two members of the study team independently screened studies for inclusion criteria and extracted data. Studies reporting data that could be transformed into grams of ethanol per week were included in the meta-analysis. The mean difference in grams of ethanol per week between eSBI and control groups was weighted using the random-effects method based on the inverse-variance approach to control for differences in sample size between studies. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant mean difference in grams of ethanol consumed per week between those receiving an eSBI versus controls at up to 3 months (mean difference -32.74, 95% CI -56.80 to -8.68, z=2.67, P=.01), 3 to less than 6 months (mean difference -17.33, 95% CI -31.82 to -2.84, z=2.34, P=.02), and from 6 months to less than 12 months follow-up (mean difference -14.91, 95% CI -25.56 to -4.26, z=2.74, P=.01). No statistically significant difference was found at a follow-up period of 12 months or greater (mean difference -7.46, 95% CI -25.34 to 10.43, z=0.82, P=.41). CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in weekly alcohol consumption between intervention and control conditions was demonstrated between 3 months and less than 12 months follow-up indicating eSBI is an effective intervention.			2014				3064
Cruciferous Vegetables and Risk of Colorectal Neoplasms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Tse, G. and Eslick, G. D.				nutrition and cancer	nutrition and cancer	Evidence shows cruciferous vegetables exhibit chemoprotective properties, commonly attributed to their rich source of isothiocyanates. However, epidemiological data examining the association between cruciferous vegetable intake and colorectal neoplasms have been inconclusive. This meta-analysis examines the epidemiological evidence to characterize the association between cruciferous vegetable intake and risk of developing colorectal neoplasms. Thirty-three articles were included in the meta-analysis after a literature search of electronic databases. Subgroup analysis for individual cruciferae types (n= 8 studies) and GST polymorphism (n= 8 studies) were performed. Pooled adjusted odds ratios (ORs) comparing highest and lowest categories of dietary pattern scores were calculated. Results show a statistically significant inverse association between cruciferous vegetable intake and colon cancer [OR = 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.720.98;Pvalue heterogeneity < 0.001]. Broccoli in particular exhibited protective benefits against colorectal (CRC) neoplasms (OR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.650.99;Pvalue heterogeneity = 0.02). Stratification by GST genotype reveals that theGSTT1null genotype confers a reduction in CRC risk (OR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.640.95;Pvalue heterogeneity = 0.32). This study provides support to the hypothesis that cruciferous vegetable intake protects against cancer of the colon. This study also demonstrates the significance of genediet interactions and the importance of assessing individual cruciferous vegetables.			2014				3493
Organ and tissue donation in clinical settings: a systematic review of the impact of interventions aimed at health professionals		Douville, F., Godin, G. and Vézina-Im, L. A.				transplantation research	transplantation research	In countries where presumed consent for organ donation does not apply, health professionals (HP) are key players for identifying donors and obtaining their consent. This systematic review was designed to verify the efficacy of interventions aimed at HPs to promote organ and tissue donation in clinical settings. CINAHL (1982 to 2012), COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE (1974 to 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), PsycINFO (1960 to 2012), and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses were searched for papers published in French or English until September 2012. Studies were considered if they met the following criteria: aimed at improving HPs' practices regarding the donation process or at increasing donation rates; HPs working in clinical settings; and interventions with a control group or pre-post assessments. Intervention behavioral change techniques were analyzed using a validated taxonomy. A risk ratio was computed for each study having a control group. A total of 15 studies were identified, of which only 5 had a control group. Interventions were either educational, organizational or a combination of both, and had a weak theoretical basis. The most common behavior change technique was providing instruction. Two sets of interventions showed a significant risk ratio. However, most studies did not report the information needed to compute their efficacy. Therefore, interventions aimed at improving the donation process or at increasing donation rates should be based on sound theoretical frameworks. They would benefit from more rigorous evaluation methods to ensure good knowledge translation and appropriate organizational decisions to improve professional practices.			2014				3110
A meta-analysis and theoretical critique of oxytocin and psychosis: Prospects for attachment and compassion in promoting recovery		Gumley, A., Braehler, C. and Macbeth, A.				the british journal of clinical psychology / the british psychological society	the british journal of clinical psychology / the british psychological society	Objectives There is now considerable evidence that affiliative processes are linked to oxytocin ( OXT), which is linked to a range of social-cognition competences underpinning interpersonal functioning. There is evidence that OXT circuitry is involved in psychosis and emerging evidence for OXT in treatment. Therefore, this study explored studies investigating OXT and improvements in symptoms and social cognition among individuals diagnosed with psychosis. Method We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials investigating OXT and psychosis. Specifically we asked, (1) what is the evidence that OXT is associated with improved overall, positive, negative and general symptoms and (2) what is the evidence that OXT is associated with improved social cognition? Results There were seven randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review. We conducted an exploratory meta-analysis of data from four of these studies on a total sample size of n = 105. For overall symptoms, using a random-effects model OXT versus placebo was associated with an effect size of d = 0.52 (95% CI = 0.34-0.70; z = 5.66; p < .01). There was evidence of significant heterogeneity ( Q = 96.4, p < .001; I<sup>2</sup> = 96.5%). Similar patterns of findings were observed for positive, negative, and general symptoms. We found significant evidence of high risk of bias across all studies. We also identified that one particular study had an undue effect on overall effect size estimates. Finally, evidence regarding OXT was linked to improved social cognition was inconsistent. Conclusions There are significant problems in interpreting the current evidence base for OXT in psychosis. However, OXT may provide a useful biomarker for exploring mechanisms of change occurring in psychological therapies including compassion-focused therapy (CFT), which through its engagement of the attachment system may directly influence OXT. Practitioner points Positive clinical implications Practitioners should consider the attachment and/or interpersonal context of both psychological and pharmacological therapies., There may be a specific role CFT in fostering social cognition and mentalization as a context for emotional and psychiatric recovery., Future clinical trials of CFT in psychosis could consider mapping changes in social cognition onto changes in OXT thereby linking important domains of emotional and social recovery to underlying and salient neurophysiological systems., Limitations Small number of studies included in the review., Not possible to determine mechanisms of change in trials of OXT.			2014				3927
Systematic review of percutaneous closure versus medical therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale		Spencer, F. A., Lopes, L. C., Kennedy, S. A. and Guyatt, G.				bmj open	bmj open	OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive comparison of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure versus medical therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and demonstrated PFO. DESIGN: Systematic review with complete case meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses. Data sources included MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1980 up to May 2013. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment with percutaneous catheter-based closure of PFO to anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA and echocardiographically confirmed PFO or atrial septal defect (ASD) were eligible. PARTICIPANTS: 1967 participants with prior stroke or TIA and echocardiographically confirmed PFO or ASD. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest was recurrence of ischaemic stroke. We utilised data from complete cases only for the primary endpoint and combined data from trials to estimate the pooled risk ratio (RR) and associated 95% CIs calculated using random effects models. RESULTS: We identified 284 potentially eligible articles of which three RCTs including 2303 patients proved eligible and 1967 patients had complete data. Of the 1026 patients randomised to PFO closure and followed to study conclusion 22 experienced non-fatal ischaemic strokes, as did 34 of 941 patients randomised to medical therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.07; heterogeneity: p=0.34, I(2)=8%, confidence in estimates low due to risk of bias and imprecision). Analyses for ischaemic stroke restricted to 'per-protocol' patients or patients with concomitant atrial septal aneurysm did not substantially change the observed RRs. Complication rates associated with either PFO closure or medical therapy were low. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled data from three RCTs provides insufficient support that PFO closure is preferable to medical therapy for secondary prevention of cryptogenic stroke in patients with PFO.			2014				3151
Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Ruan, S. Y., Lin, H. H., Huang, C. T., Kuo, P. H., Wu, H. D. and Yu, C. J.				critical care (london, england)	critical care (london, england)	INTRODUCTION: The effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy on the mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains under debate. We aimed to explore the grounds for the inconsistent results in previous studies and update the evidence. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science up to December 2013. Eligible studies included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that reported mortality and that had corticosteroid nonusers for comparison. The effect of corticosteroids on ARDS mortality was assessed by relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for ICU, hospital, and 60-day mortality using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Eight RCTs and 10 cohort studies were included for analysis. In RCTs, corticosteroids had a possible but statistically insignificant effect on ICU mortality (RD, -0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.53 to -0.03 and RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.25) but no effect on 60-day mortality (RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.10 and RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.26). In cohort studies, corticosteroids had no effect on ICU mortality (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.49) but non-significantly increased 60-day mortality (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.78). In the subgroup analysis by ARDS etiology, corticosteroids significantly increased mortality in influenza-related ARDS (three cohort studies, RR, 2.45, 95% CI, 1.40 to 4.27). CONCLUSIONS: The effects of corticosteroids on the mortality of ARDS differed by duration of outcome measures and etiologies. Corticosteroids did not improve longer-term outcomes and may cause harm in certain subgroups. Current data do not support routine use of corticosteroids in ARDS. More clinical trials are needed to specify the favorable and unfavorable subgroups for corticosteroid therapy.			2014				3576
Effect of metformin intervention during pregnancy on the gestational diabetes mellitus in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Zhuo, Z., Wang, A. and Yu, H.				journal of diabetes research	journal of diabetes research	Metformin is an effective insulin sensitizer treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the functional consequences of metformin administration throughout pregnancy on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have not been assessed. We therefore performed a meta-analysis and system review to determine the effect of metformin on GDM in PCOS. A meta-analysis was performed on the published studies before December, 2013. Meta-analysis examined whether metformin could reduce GDM occurrence in PCOS with a fixed effect model. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated to estimate the strength of association. A total of 13 studies including 5 RCTs and 8 non-RCTs were enrolled. Ultimately, effectiveness analysis demonstrated that, in total, there was no significant availability of metformin on GDM in PCOS in contrast to placebo (OR?=?1.07, 95% CI 0.60-1.92) in RCTs and significant availability of metformin on GDM (OR?=?0.19, 95% CI 0.13-0.27) was indicated in non-RCTs. In summary, according to the results of our meta-analysis, strictly, metformin did not significantly effect on GDM with PCOS, though more multicenters RCTs still need to be investigated.			2014				3618
Systemic Therapy for Non-clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinomas: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Vera-Badillo, F. E., Templeton, A. J., Duran, I., Ocana, A., de Gouveia, P., Aneja, P., Knox, J. J., Tannock, I. F., Escudier, B. and Amir, E.				european urology	european urology	CONTEXT: Clinical data supporting the use of targeted agents for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are based predominantly on patients with clear cell histology. Little is known about the efficacy of these drugs in non-clear cell variants. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of different clear cell RCC (ccRCC)-approved targeted agents among patients with non-ccRCC compared with ccRCC. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We conducted a systematic review of electronic databases to identify publications evaluating the outcomes of patients with non-ccRCC treated with targeted agents approved for treatment of ccRCC. Patients with sarcomatoid variant RCC were excluded from the main analysis but were evaluated as an independent cohort. End points of interest were response rate, median progression-free survival (PFS), and median overall survival (OS). Where possible, data were pooled in a meta-analysis. For studies of unselected patients with RCC, the outcomes of patients with non-ccRCC histology were compared with ccRCC. In exploratory analyses, outcomes of non-ccRCC with nonapproved agents were assessed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 49 studies comprising 7771 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 1244 patients (16.0%) had non-ccRCC, 6300 (83.1%) had ccRCC, and 227 (2.9%) had sarcomatoid tumours. The overall response rate for non-ccRCC with targeted agents was 10.5%. In studies directly comparing non-ccRCC and ccRCC, there were significantly lower response rates for non-ccRCC (odds ratio for response: 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.68; p<0.001). For non-ccRCC treated with targeted agents, median PFS and OS were 7.4 and 13.4 mo, respectively; for patients with ccRCC, these were 10.5 mo and 15.7 mo, respectively (p value for difference <0.001 for both parameters). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (non-ccRCC) have significantly lower response rates and poorer median progression-free survival and overall survival than those with ccRCC. The optimal treatment of patients with non-ccRCC remains unclear and warrants further study. PATIENT SUMMARY: Systemic treatments for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tend to be significantly less effective for non-clear cell RCC, with lower response rates and worse progression-free survival and overall survival when compared with clear cell RCC. Optimal therapy remains unclear and warrants further study.			2015				7163
Efficacy of combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin in treatment of invasive aspergillosis: a systematic review of animal and human studies		Zhang, M., Sun, W. K., Wu, T., Chen, F., Xu, X. Y., Su, X. and Shi, Y.				journal of thoracic disease	journal of thoracic disease	OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of the combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin in treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains controversial. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin in treatment of IA. METHODS: Relevant articles on the combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin in IA, including the animal studies and clinical studies from January 1966 to October 2013, were searched on Web of Science, PubMed and Cochrane Library. The prolongation of survival of the combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin in IA was performed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: Nine animal studies with a total of 1,582 animals and five clinical trials totaling 872 patients were included. The survival of the included animal studies with combination therapy was significantly prolonged compared with echinocandin alone [RR =2.26, (95% CI, 1.79-2.87; P<0.00001)], but no statistical difference compared with monotherapy of triazole [RR =1.19, (95% CI, 0.98-1.44; P=0.08)]. Of the four human cohort studies, two studies observed that the combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin was associated with a significant reduction in mortality compared with other treatments, and one study might be considered as a preferable therapy [HR =0.58, (95% CI, 0.3-1.14; P=0.117)]. While another study revealed that there was no significant difference among the combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin and either of the monotherapy. In the randomized clinical trial (RCT), of the 135 patients who received the combination therapy, 39 died, while 55 died out of 142 patients who received monotherapy (P=0.08, 95% CI, -21.4, 1.09) by week 12. CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of triazole and echinocandin in treating IA results in a trend towards improved overall survival in animals' studies and clinical studies. Well-designed RCTs and further improved clinical trials are necessary to study the effectiveness of the combination therapy.			2014				3237
The safety and efficiency of surgery with colonic stents in left-sided malignant colonic obstruction: a meta-analysis		Zhao, X., Liu, B., Zhao, E., Wang, J., Cai, M., Xia, Z., Xia, Q., Shuai, X., Tao, K., Wang, G. and Cai, K.				gastroenterology research and practice	gastroenterology research and practice	Objective. This meta-analysis is aimed at assessing the safety and efficiency of colonic self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) used as a bridge to surgery in the management of left-sided malignant colonic obstruction (LMCO). Methods. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Knowledge, OVID, Google Scholar, CNKI, and WANGFANG for relevant randomized trials comparing colonic stenting used as a bridge in semielective surgery versus emergency surgery from January 2001 to September 2013. Result. Five published studies were included in this systematic review, including 273 patients (140 male/133 female). 136 patients received semielective surgery after SEMS installation while 137 patients underwent emergency surgery without SEMS. SEMS intervention resulted in significantly lower overall colostomy rate (41.9% versus 56.2%, P = 0.02), surgical site infection rate (10.2% versus 19.7%, P = 0.03), and overall complication rate (29.2% versus 60.5%, P = 0.05). There was no statistic difference for the rate of primary anastomosis, anastomotic leak and operation-related mortality between two groups. Conclusions. semielective surgery with SEMS as a bridge for proper patients of LMCO can lower the overall rate for colostomy, surgical site infection, and complications.			2014				3741
Systematic review of efficacy and safety of pemetrexed in non-small-cell-lung cancer		Pérez-Moreno, M. A., Galván-Banqueri, M., Flores-Moreno, S., Villalba-Moreno, A., Cotrina-Luque, J. and Bautista-Paloma, F. J.				international journal of clinical pharmacy	international journal of clinical pharmacy	INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer accounts for 20 % of cancer deaths in Spain. The most frequent subtype (87 %) is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pemetrexed is a recently marketed drug added to NSCLC therapeutic arsenal. It seems to have become one of the most used options for the treatment of this condition over the last 3 years. AIM OF THE REVIEW: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed in NSCLC, in the different therapy lines. METHOD: A systematic search of published literature was conducted using the main databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the Center for Reviews and Dissemination) and subsequently a search of referenced literature was performed. We included clinical trials, meta-analyses and systematic reviews. The evaluation of the quality of the articles was performed by pairs using specific assessment scales, Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) adapted for CASP Spain. Then we extracted data on efficacy and safety according to the treatment line assessed. RESULTS: We identified 277 references. Finally, nine clinical trials and a meta-analysis complied with inclusion criteria. In first-line induction, treatment with pemetrexed associated with a platinum was similar in terms of efficacy to other alternative chemotherapy regimens, except in patients with non-squamous histology, in whom survival was higher in the experimental group. In maintenance treatment, greater efficacy was seen with pemetrexed in patients with non-squamous histology. In second-line treatment, there were no significant differences in terms of efficacy and safety for pemetrexed treatment versus other chemotherapy options. The most frequent adverse reactions were: hematological, gastrointestinal and neurological. All were significantly less frequent with pemetrexed versus other alternative therapies, except for liver toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the high degree of uncertainty as to its efficacy in certain subgroups of patients, including conflicting data; to its recent incorporation, and therefore lack of safety data in the medium and long term, and the high budgetary impact of its incorporation into health systems, it seems reasonable to optimize its use, identifying those patients who may benefit most.			2014				2861
Communication between health professionals and patients: review of studies using the RIAS (Roter Interaction Analysis System) method		Pires, C. M. and Cavaco, A. M.				revista da associação médica brasileira (1992)	revista da associação médica brasileira (1992)	OBJECTIVE: Systematic review of studies that investigate the communication between patients and health professionals with the application of the RIAS methodology. METHODS: Keyword Roter Interaction Analysis System was searched in the following bibliographic resources: Academic Search Complete, Current Contents, ISI Proceedings, PubMed, Elsevier, SpringerLink, Web of Science, RCAAP, Solo and the official RIAS site. Selection period: 2006 to 2011. Studies were selected using multicriteria dichotomous analysis and organized according to PRISMA. RESULTS: Identification of 1,262 articles (455 unrepeated). 34 articles were selected for analysis, distributed by the following health professions: family medicine and general practitioners (14), pediatricians (5), nurses (4), geneticists (3), carers of patients with AIDS (2), oncologists (2), surgeons (2), anesthetists (1) and family planning specialists (1). The RIAS is scarcely used and publicized within the scope of healthcare in Portuguese speaking countries. DISCUSSION: Main themes studied include the influence of tiredness, anxiety and professional burnout on communication and the impact of specific training actions on professional activities. The review enabled the identification of the main strengths and weaknesses of synchronous and dyadic verbal communication within the provision of healthcare. CONCLUSION: Scientific investigation of the communication between health professionals and patients using RIAS has produced concrete results. An improvement is expected in health outcomes through the application of the RIAS.			2014				3771
Use of labour induction and risk of cesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Mishanina, E., Rogozinska, E., Thatthi, T., Uddin-Khan, R., Khan, K. S. and Meads, C.				cmaj : canadian medical association journal = journal de l'association medicale canadienne	cmaj : canadian medical association journal = journal de l'association medicale canadienne	BACKGROUND: Induction of labour is common, and cesarean delivery is regarded as its major complication. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether the risk of cesarean delivery is higher or lower following labour induction compared with expectant management. METHODS: We searched 6 electronic databases for relevant articles published through April 2012 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which labour induction was compared with placebo or expectant management among women with a viable singleton pregnancy. We assessed risk of bias and obtained data on rates of cesarean delivery. We used regression analysis techniques to explore the effect of patient characteristics, induction methods and study quality on risk of cesarean delivery. RESULTS: We identified 157 eligible RCTs (n = 31,085). Overall, the risk of cesarean delivery was 12% lower with labour induction than with expectant management (pooled relative risk [RR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.93; I(2) = 0%). The effect was significant in term and post-term gestations but not in preterm gestations. Meta-regression analysis showed that initial cervical score, indication for induction and method of induction did not alter the main result. There was a reduced risk of fetal death (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25-0.99; I(2) = 0%) and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.94), and no impact on maternal death (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.10-9.57; I(2) = 0%) with labour induction. INTERPRETATION: The risk of cesarean delivery was lower among women whose labour was induced than among those managed expectantly in term and post-term gestations. There were benefits for the fetus and no increased risk of maternal death.			2014				3010
[Effectiveness of selective strengthening exercise for the arist in subacute and chronic tennis elbow]		Dietsche, M., Ernst, M. and Zhaw - Zürcher Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften, C. H. Winterthur				manuelle therapie	manuelle therapie	There are several conservative treatment modalities for lateral epicondylopathy (tennis elbow). The effectiveness of strengthening exercises alone is not evident in intervention studies, due to the usage of other physiotherapeutic interventions in these studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis portrays the effectiveness of wrist extensor strengthening exercise in tennis elbow for the outcome measures pain, strength, reduced activity and general improvement. In summary, strengthening exercise proved to be just as effective as equivalent interventions. However, due to the small amount of high quality randomised studies, these results must be interpreted carefully.			2014				3687
A systematic review of evidence-based cancer education media interventions to improve cancer screening behaviors among African Americans in the United States		Adedoyin, Adedamola Christson Adeoluwa				dissertation abstracts international section a: humanities and social sciences	dissertation abstracts international section a: humanities and social sciences	Cancer incidence and fatality rates are highest among African Americans compared to other races in the United States. Empirical evidence suggests that culturally sensitive and literacy appropriate cancer education media interventions reduce cancer mortality and disparities among African Americans. However, there is no evidence in extant literature that identifies the cancer education media interventions that works best and is most effective for African Americans. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to conduct a research synthesis that systematically and methodologically identified, examined and evaluated studies that focused on cancer education media interventions for African Americans. Consequently, a systematic literature search was conducted for published and gray studies using ten computerized databases. Out of 179 publications identified, only 41 met the inclusion-exclusion criteria. The dependent variables were obtaining screening, knowledge intention and attitudes (KIA). The independent variables were type of cancer education media (e.g. print, TV, and multiple media). Study descriptors were also identified (e.g. research designs and theoretical framework). Overall, multiple media (N=16) was the mostly used cancer education media followed by print (N=12), audio visual (N=8), computer-based (N=3), web-based (N=1) and telephone (N=1) respectively. The following type of cancer screening practices was observed: Breast (N=17), colorectal (N=10), prostate (N=9), cervical (N=3), breast and cervical (N=2). Furthermore, the study revealed preferred and widely used settings such as churched-based setting (N=16), hospital/clinics (N=13) and community-based organizations (N=12). Studies that focused on breast screening were most effective, followed by colorectal, prostate, cervical and breast and cervical respectively. Furthermore, study quality assessment revealed that 13 breast cancer screening studies, eight prostate cancer screening studies and three colorectal and cervical cancer screenings were found to be strongly rated. Only one study was strongly rated for breast and cervical cancer screening. The most effective cancer education media among African Americans was multiple media. The study revealed that culturally sensitive, and literacy appropriate cancer education media interventions are effective and therefore, reduces cancer incidence, mortality and disparities among African Americans. Implications for social work are highlighted in relation to maximizing the underutilized potential and competencies of social workers in their role as cancer educators.

Hydroxyethyl starch in sepsis		Haase, N. R.				danish medical journal	danish medical journal	BACKGROUND: Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is a colloid that has been widely used for fluid resuscitation for decades. The newest generation of HES, tetrastarch, was believed to provide an efficient volume expansion without causing the side effects observed with former HES solutions. However, this belief was based on physiological models and small studies rather than on firm clinical evidence. Our aim was to assess the safety and efficacy of tetrastarch in a randomised clinical trial and in a systematic review. METHODS: We first conducted a blinded, clinical trial, in which we randomly assigned patients with severe sepsis in the intensive care unit to fluid resuscitation with either 6% HES 130/0.42 (Tetraspan) or Ringer's acetate. The primary outcome measure was death or dialysis-dependency at 90 days after randomisation. Secondary outcomes described kidney function and serious adverse reactions. Secondly, we systematically identified all randomised clinical trials comparing tetrastarch with either crystalloid or albumin in patients with sepsis and pooled their results in meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses. RESULTS: Of the 804 patients who underwent randomisation, 798 were included in the modified-intention-to-treat population. At 90 days after randomisation, 201 of 398 patients (51%) assigned to HES 130/0.42 had died, as compared with 172 of 400 patients (43%) assigned to Ringer's acetate (relative risk 1.17, p=0.03); 1 patient in each group was dialysis-dependent at 90 days. In the 90 day observation period, 87 patients (22%) assigned to HES received renal replacement therapy vs. 65 patients (16%) assigned to Ringer's acetate (relative risk 1.35, p=0.04), and 38 patients (10%) vs. 25 patients (6%) had severe bleeding (relative risk 1.52, p=0.09). Post-hoc sensitivity analysis showed a strongly significant increased risk of any bleeding with HES vs. Ringer's acetate (relative risk 1.56, p=0.003). In the systematic review, we identified nine trials that randomised 3,456 patients with sepsis. In meta-analyses, tetrastarch vs. crystalloid or albumin lead to increased use of renal replacement therapy (relative risk 1.36, p=0.009) and red blood cells (relative risk 1.29, p=0.0002) and to more serious adverse events (relative risk 1.30, p=0.03). Trials with low risk of bias suggested 11% increased risk of death. After adjusting the results with trial sequential analysis signals for harm persisted. CONCLUSION: Our randomised clinical trial is one of several high-quality trials in critically ill patients with and without sepsis that now provide evidence that the use of tetrastarch impairs kidney function and haemostasis and may even increase mortality. Whether the results can be extrapolated to other types of patients is unclear, but so far no group of patients with an overall benefit of HES beyond surrogate markers has been identified. In line with this, the European Medicines Agency's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee now recommends that the marketing authorisations of all HES solutions are suspended in the European Union.			2014				3949
Open Surgery Versus Nonoperative Treatments for Paediatric Trigger Thumb: a Systematic Review		Farr, S., Grill, F., Ganger, R. and Girsch, W.				the journal of hand surgery, european volume	the journal of hand surgery, european volume	The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the outcome of interphalangeal (IP) joint motion in children undergoing open surgical release, splinting, and passive exercising therapy for the treatment of paediatric trigger thumb. We conducted an online literature search of seven major databases. Only studies with a mean follow-up of at least 12 months were considered for inclusion. Seventeen retrospective studies and one prospective study met all the inclusion criteria. They reported on the results of surgery (634 children, 759 thumbs), splinting (115 children, 138 thumbs), and passive exercising (89 children, 108 thumbs). The mean follow-up periods were 59 (surgery), 23 (splinting), and 76 months (exercising), respectively. Full IP joint motion without residual triggering was achieved in 95% of all children undergoing surgery, in 67% of children treated with continuous splinting, and 55% after passive exercising. Based on the low level of evidence available, it seems that open surgery resulted in more reliable and rapid outcomes compared with nonoperative treatment.			2014				2780
Selenium Supplementation for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: Summary of a Cochrane Systematic Review		van Zuuren, E. J., Albusta, A. Y., Fedorowicz, Z., Carter, B. and Pijl, H.				european thyroid journal	european thyroid journal	Selenium supplementation in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis might reduce antibody levels and result in a decreased dosage of levothyroxine (LT4) and may provide other beneficial effects (e.g. on mood and health-related quality of life). The aim of our systematic review was to assess the effects of selenium supplementation on Hashimoto's thyroiditis. We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials. Study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias and analyses were carried out by two independent review authors. We assessed the quality of the evidence of included studies using GRADE. Four studies rated at unclear to high risk of bias comprising 463 participants were included. One study at high risk of bias showed statistically significant improvement in subjective well-being with sodium selenite 200 ?g plus titrated LT4 compared with placebo plus titrated LT4 (RR 4.67, 95% CI 1.61-13.50). Selenomethionine 200 ?g as a single treatment or combined with LT4 reduced the serum levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies compared with placebo (or placebo plus LT4) in three studies (p < 0.001). Although the changes from baseline were statistically significant in these three studies, their clinical relevance is unclear. In conclusion, the results of these four studies, assessed at unclear to high risk of bias, show that evidence to support or refute the efficacy of selenium supplementation in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is incomplete and not reliable to help inform clinical decision making.			2014				2823
Dietary educational interventions for management of hyperphosphatemia in hemodialysis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Karavetian, M., de Vries, N., Rizk, R. and Elzein, H.				nutrition reviews	nutrition reviews	Strategies to enhance knowledge of and adherence to dietary guidelines for management of hyperphosphatemia in hemodialysis patients have been studied extensively over the past decade. This review is the first to compile all of them (2003-2013) and conduct a meta-analysis through calculation of effect size, with the aim of identifying the optimal nutrition education methods for effective management of hyperphosphatemia in hemodialysis patients. The following strategies were identified as being effective in changing dietary behavior: 1) use of self-evaluation and self-regulation techniques within educational tools, along with easy-to-apply skills; 2) individualized counseling by a renal dietitian provided just before the hemodialysis session; 3) high-intensity education; and 4) long duration of interventions. Future studies should focus on conducting randomized controlled trials with powered samples to help generate stronger evidence.			2014				3486
Curcumin as a therapeutic agent in dementia: a mini systematic review of human studies		Brondino, N., Re, S., Boldrini, A., Cuccomarino, A., Lanati, N., Barale, F. and Politi, P.				thescientificworldjournal	thescientificworldjournal	Dementia is a leading health problem worldwide, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) representing up to 60% of all dementia cases. A growing interest has recently risen on the potential use of natural molecules in this condition. Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound traditionally used in Indian medicine. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have found a protective effect of curcumin in AD. In the present systematic review we aimed to evaluate the state-of-the-art of clinical trials of curcumin in AD. We retrieved three published studies, while there are several ongoing clinical trials. To date there is insufficient evidence to suggest the use of curcumin in dementia patients. Of note, short-term use of curcumin appears to be safe. Several reasons could be responsible for the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo findings and human trials, such as low bioavailability and poor study design.			2014				2782
The impact of Community Mobilisation on HIV Prevention in Middle and Low Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Critique		Cornish, F., Priego-Hernandez, J., Campbell, C., Mburu, G. and McLean, S.				aids and behavior	aids and behavior	While community mobilisation (CM) is increasingly advocated for HIV prevention, its impact on measurable outcomes has not been established. We performed a systematic review of the impact of CM within HIV prevention interventions (N = 20), on biomedical, behavioural and social outcomes. Among most at risk groups (particularly sex workers), the evidence is somewhat consistent, indicating a tendency for positive impact, with stronger results for behavioural and social outcomes than for biomedical ones. Among youth and general communities, the evidence remains inconclusive. Success appears to be enhanced by engaging groups with a strong collective identity and by simultaneously addressing the socio-political context. We suggest that the inconclusiveness of the findings reflects problems with the evidence, rather than indicating that CM is ineffective. We discuss weaknesses in the operationalization of CM, neglect of social context, and incompatibility between context-specific CM processes and the aspiration of review methodologies to provide simple, context-transcending answers.			2014				2952
A systematic review of contemporary trials of anticoagulants in orthopaedic thromboprophylaxis: suggestions for a radical reappraisal		Chan, N. C., Siegal, D., Lauw, M. N., Ginsberg, J. S., Eikelboom, J. W., Guyatt, G. H. and Hirsh, J.				journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis	journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis	In the last decade, major advances in venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery have included the development of new anticoagulants that are poised to replace low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and improvements in operative and perioperative care that have likely led to a decline in the rates of symptomatic VTE and mortality independent of anticoagulant use. A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify phase III randomized controlled trials of VTE prevention that compared new anticoagulants (fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban) with LMWH (enoxaparin) in major elective orthopaedic surgery. Our aims were to obtain best estimates of the rates of patient important events (symptomatic VTE, mortality, and bleeding) in contemporary trials of VTE prevention, and to consider the implications of these contemporary rates for clinical practice and future research. Fourteen studies, which enrolled 40,285 patients, were included in the analyses. The combined median rates (ranges) for all five anticoagulants for symptomatic VTE and mortality to the end of follow-up were 0.99 % (0.15-2.58 %) and 0.26 % (0-0.92 %) respectively, whereas the median rate (range) of clinically important bleeding was 3.44 % (2.25-7.74 %). In contemporary trials of anticoagulants, the rates of symptomatic VTE and mortality are low, but the rates of clinically important post-operative bleeding remain relatively high. Based on these results, we propose that approaches that minimize bleeding without substantially reducing efficacy merit investigation, particularly if improvement in surgical and perioperative care have also resulted in falling baseline patient important VTE rates independent of anticoagulant use.			2015				6627
Evidence-based risk communication: a systematic review		Zipkin, D. A., Umscheid, C. A., Keating, N. L., Allen, E., Aung, K., Beyth, R., Kaatz, S., Mann, D. M., Sussman, J. B., Korenstein, D., Schardt, C., Nagi, A., Sloane, R. and Feldstein, D. A.				annals of internal medicine	annals of internal medicine	BACKGROUND: Effective communication of risks and benefits to patients is critical for shared decision making. PURPOSE: To review the comparative effectiveness of methods of communicating probabilistic information to patients that maximize their cognitive and behavioral outcomes. DATA SOURCES: PubMed (1966 to March 2014) and CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1966 to December 2011) using several keywords and structured terms. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective or cross-sectional studies that recruited patients or healthy volunteers and compared any method of communicating probabilistic information with another method. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers extracted study characteristics and assessed risk of bias. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eighty-four articles, representing 91 unique studies, evaluated various methods of numerical and visual risk display across several risk scenarios and with diverse outcome measures. Studies showed that visual aids (icon arrays and bar graphs) improved patients' understanding and satisfaction. Presentations including absolute risk reductions were better than those including relative risk reductions for maximizing accuracy and seemed less likely than presentations with relative risk reductions to influence decisions to accept therapy. The presentation of numbers needed to treat reduced understanding. Comparative effects of presentations of frequencies (such as 1 in 5) versus event rates (percentages, such as 20%) were inconclusive. LIMITATION: Most studies were small and highly variable in terms of setting, context, and methods of administering interventions. CONCLUSION: Visual aids and absolute risk formats can improve patients' understanding of probabilistic information, whereas numbers needed to treat can lessen their understanding. Due to study heterogeneity, the superiority of any single method for conveying probabilistic information is not established, but there are several good options to help clinicians communicate with patients. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.			2014				3267
Impact of physical exercise on quality of life of older adults with depression or Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review		Tavares, B. B., Moraes, H., Deslandes, A. C. and Laks, J.				trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy	trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy	INTRODUCTION: Physical exercise has been associated with improvement of quality of live (QoL), but its effect among the elderly with depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unclear. This systematic review evaluated randomized and controlled studies about the effect of physical exercise on QoL of older individuals with a clinical diagnosis of depression and AD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, ISI, SciELO and Scopus from December 2011 to June 2013 using the following keywords: physical exercise, quality of life, elderly, depression, Alzheimer's disease. Only six studies met inclusion criteria: two examined patients with AD and four, patients with depression. RESULTS: The studies used different methods to prescribe exercise and evaluate QoL, but all had high quality methods. Findings of most studies with individuals with depression suggested that exercise training improved QoL, but studies with patients with AD had divergent results. CONCLUSIONS: Although different methods were used, results suggested that physical exercise is an effective non-pharmacological intervention to improve the QoL of elderly individuals with depression and AD. Future studies should investigate the effect of other factors, such as the use of specific scales for the elderly, controlled exercise prescriptions and type of control groups.			2014				3118
An updated systematic review of lung chemo-radiotherapy using a new evidence aggregation method		Williams, M., Liu, Z. W., Hunter, A. and Macbeth, F.				lung cancer (amsterdam, netherlands)	lung cancer (amsterdam, netherlands)	"OBJECTIVE: The main treatment for locally-advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is radical radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. Numerous trials have been performed, the results of which often disagree. Despite publication of several systematic reviews, there is not a consensus on practice, and outcomes are poor. To address this problem, we have applied a recently published evidence aggregation method to update the Cochrane systematic review (CSR) of lung chemo-radiotherapy. METHOD: We extracted data on 28 trials consisting of 4352 patients treated using 54 different regimens. We aggregated trials involving heterogeneous outcomes (both effects and side-effects). Our method identifies the evidence for the ""best"" treatment using preference criteria over outcomes and criteria concerning evidence quality. RESULT: Concurrent, platinum-based, conventionally fractionated chemo-radiotherapy was the most strongly supported option. 60Gy in 30 fractions with concurrent cisplatin and vinblastine was superior under all combinations of preference criteria and evidence quality criteria that were considered. There was evidence for the use of concurrent and consolidation chemotherapy with conventionally-fractionated radiotherapy, but the choice of individual regimen was highly dependent on the choices for preference criteria over outcomes and for the criteria concerning evidence quality. DISCUSSION: Using evidence from the trials analysed in the CSR, together with some more recent studies, we identify a finer-grained recommendation than the CSR, though our findings are consistent with that of the CSR. Furthermore, we have identified individual regimens that may be optimal."			2015				6088
Psychological and pharmacological interventions for social anxiety disorder in adults: A systematic review and network meta-analysis		Mayo-Wilson, Evan, Dias, Sofia, Mavranezouli, Ifigeneia, Kew, Kayleigh, Clark, David M., Ades, A. E. and Pilling, Stephen				the lancet psychiatry	the lancet psychiatry	BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disordera chronic and naturally unremitting disease that causes substantial impairmentcan be treated with pharmacological, psychological, and self-help interventions. We aimed to compare these interventions and to identify which are most effective for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults. METHODS: We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder, identified from published and unpublished sources between 1988 and Sept 13, 2013. We analysed interventions by class and individually. Outcomes were validated measures of social anxiety, reported as standardised mean differences (SMDs) compared with a waitlist reference. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012003146. FINDINGS: We included 101 trials (13 164 participants) of 41 interventions or control conditions (17 classes) in the analyses. Classes of pharmacological interventions that had greater effects on outcomes compared with waitlist were monoamine oxidase inhibitors (SMD 1·01, 95% credible interval [CrI] 1·56 to 0·45), benzodiazepines (0·96, 1·56 to 0·36), selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs; 0·91, 1·23 to 0·60), and anticonvulsants (0·81, 1·36 to 0·28). Compared with waitlist, efficacious classes of psychological interventions were individual cognitivebehavioural therapy (CBT; SMD 1·19, 95% CrI 1·56 to 0·81), group CBT (0·92, 1·33 to 0·51), exposure and social skills (0·86, 1·42 to 0·29), self-help with support (0·86, 1·36 to 0·36), self-help without support (0·75, 1·25 to 0·26), and psychodynamic psychotherapy (0·62, 0·93 to 0·31). Individual CBT compared with psychological placebo (SMD 0·56, 95% CrI 1·00 to 0·11), and SSRIs and SNRIs compared with pill placebo (0·44, 0·67 to 0·22) were the only classes of interventions that had greater effects on outcomes than appropriate placebo. Individual CBT also had a greater effect than psychodynamic psychotherapy (SMD 0·56, 95% CrI 1·03 to 0·11) and interpersonal psychotherapy, mindfulness, and supportive therapy (0·82, 1·41 to 0·24). INTERPRETATION: Individual CBT (which other studies have shown to have a lower risk of side-effects than pharmacotherapy) is associated with large effect sizes. Thus, it should be regarded as the best intervention for the initial treatment of social anxiety disorder.

A systematic review of localization, surgical treatment options, and outcome of insulinoma		Mehrabi, A., Fischer, L., Hafezi, M., Dirlewanger, A., Grenacher, L., Diener, M. K., Fonouni, H., Golriz, M., Garoussi, C., Fard, N., Rahbari, N. N., Werner, J. and Büchler, M. W.				pancreas	pancreas	OBJECTIVE: Insulinoma with an incidence of 0.4% is a rare pancreatic tumor. Preserving surgery is the treatment of choice. Exact localization is necessary to plan the appropriate approach. This article gives an overview on localization and surgical strategies for treatment of insulinoma. METHODS: In this systematic review, 114 articles with 6222 cases of insulinoma were reviewed with emphasis on localization techniques and surgical treatment. RESULTS: Insulinoma happens mostly in the fifth decade of life, with a higher incidence in men. They occur mostly sporadic (94%), benign (87%), and single (90%). Insulinomas are mostly smaller than 20 mm (84%). The tumors are distributed almost equally in the pancreas. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography is routinely used as first choice preoperatively. Intraoperative inspection, palpation, and sonography were applied with high success rate. Intraoperative sonography is considered as the most reliable technique. Enucleation is the most administered type of surgery (56%). Different types of resection include distal pancreatectomy (32%), Whipple procedure (3%), and subtotal pancreatectomy (<3%). Despite the development of laparoscopy, open approach is the favorite method (90%). The most common surgical complication is fistula. The mortality rate of open approach was higher (4 vs 0%). Despite high cure rate, recurrence of insulinoma occurs in 7% after surgery.			2014				2903
Clinical and safety outcomes associated with treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Castellucci, L. A., Cameron, C., Le Gal, G., Rodger, M. A., Coyle, D., Wells, P. S., Clifford, T., Gandara, E., Wells, G. and Carrier, M.				jama	jama	IMPORTANCE: Many anticoagulant strategies are available for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism, yet little guidance exists regarding which drug is most effective and safe. OBJECTIVE: To summarize and compare the efficacy and safety outcomes associated with 8 anticoagulation options (unfractionated heparin [UFH], low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH], or fondaparinux in combination with vitamin K antagonists); LMWH with dabigatran or edoxaban; rivaroxaban; apixaban; and LMWH alone) for treatment of venous thromboembolism. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the evidence-based medicine reviews from inception through February 28, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were randomized trials reporting rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding in patients with acute venous thromboembolism. Of the 1197 studies identified, 45 trials including 44,989 patients were included in the analyses. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including number of patients, duration of follow-up, and outcomes. The data were pooled using network meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary clinical and safety outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination, a treatment strategy using the UFH-vitamin K antagonist combination was associated with an increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42; 95% credible interval [CrI], 1.15-1.79). The proportion of patients experiencing recurrent venous thromboembolism during 3 months of treatment were 1.84% (95% CrI, 1.33%-2.51%) for the UFH-vitamin K antagonist combination and 1.30% (95% CrI, 1.02%-1.62%) for the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination. Rivaroxaban (HR, 0.55; 95% CrI, 0.35-0.89) and apixaban (HR, 0.31; 95% CrI, 0.15-0.62) were associated with a lower risk of bleeding than was the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination, with a lower proportion of patients experiencing a major bleeding event during 3 months of anticoagulation: 0.49% (95% CrI, 0.29%-0.85%) for rivaroxaban, 0.28% (95% CrI, 0.14%-0.50%) for apixaban, and 0.89% (95% CrI, 0.66%-1.16%) for the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using meta-analytic pooling, there were no statistically significant differences for efficacy and safety associated with most treatment strategies used to treat acute venous thromboembolism compared with the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination. However, findings suggest that the UFH-vitamin K antagonist combination is associated with the least effective strategy and that rivaroxaban and apixaban may be associated with the lowest risk for bleeding.			2014				3467
Evidence based update: Open versus closed reduction		Ghayoumi, P., Kandemir, U. and Morshed, S.				injury	injury	Outcomes after operative treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures in young adults are fraught with high complications rates including non-union and avascular necrosis. Among the therapeutic controversies that persist is the role of open reduction, which would allow surgeons a direct means to improve the quality of reduction, a predictor of successful treatment. We performed a systematic review of the literature to compare the outcomes (nonunion, avascular necrosis, and deep infection) after open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) to closed reduction with internal fixation (CRIF) of acute (surgery performed less than 6 weeks from injury) femoral neck fractures in young adults (average age of 50 or younger) followed for at least one year. Despite the large literature investigating outcomes after operative treatment of femoral neck fracture, relatively few studies aimed to determine the relative risk of complications associated with method of reduction. Therefore, both observational and randomised studies as well as case series with clear descriptions of surgical approach and outcomes were included. We identified 21 studies that matched our inclusion criteria. The incidence of nonunion was 11.6% in closed reduction and 14.9% in the open reduction group (P=0.25). The incidence of avascular necrosis for CRIF and ORIF were 17.2% and 17.7% respectively (P=0.91). The incidence of deep wound infection was 0.49% in the closed reduction group and 3.9% in the open reduction group (P=0.0019). Meta-analysis of risk ratios estimated from six of the studies with comparative data revealed no significant difference in the incidence of nonunion, avascular necrosis or total complications between the two reduction techniques. In summary, systematic review of the literature reveals a lack of evidence in support of ORIF versus CRIF as a means of treating displaced femoral neck fractures in young patients with respect to union and avascular necrosis; however, the incidence of surgical site infections may be lower with CRIF. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn given the lack of high quality prospective studies and patient reported outcomes. In the future, randomised controlled trials will be required to test the effect of reduction method.			2015				10517
Role of mobile phone technology in health education in Asian and African countries: a systematic review		Sahu, M., Grover, A. and Joshi, A.				international journal of electronic healthcare	international journal of electronic healthcare	The objective of this systematic review was to explore the role of mobile phone technologies in delivering health education programs in Asian and African countries. The search engine used was Pubmed during 2008-2011. Randomised controlled trials or controlled studies that improved health outcomes through delivery of health educational interventions using cell phone or text messaging were included in the review. Results showed studies from six Asian and African countries including Philippines, China, Kenya, South Korea, Taiwan and India. Mobile phone technology has shown to improve health outcomes for chronic disease conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. Additional conditions include obesity and cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidance. Other studies have shown improvement in self management of breast cancer and post-hospitalisation HIV and pharmaceutical care. Overall results of the present review showed that mobile phone technologies can be a possible solution to improve healthcare outcome.			2014				2732
New oral anticoagulants in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism - a systematic review with indirect comparisons		Hirschl, M. and Kundi, M.				vasa. zeitschrift für gefässkrankheiten	vasa. zeitschrift für gefässkrankheiten	BACKGROUND: For decades, heparins and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the gold standards in therapy of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The advent of factor IIa and Xa inhibitors provides new therapeutic options. The aim of this analysis is to compare the currently available new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with VKAs and also indirectly the NOACs with each other, as it is unlikely that a head-to-head comparison will ever be available. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 27,024 patients were included in the RE-COVER, RE-COVER II, EINSTEIN DVT and PE, AMPLIFY and HOKUSAI studies with 13,511 in the VKA arm and 13,513 in the NOAC arm. Efficacy and safety endpoints were assessed by relative risks (RR) and absolute risk reductions (ARR) relative to VKA. The indirect comparison between the NOACs was performed according to ISPOR guidelines. RESULTS: No differences between NOACs and VKA were found regarding recurrent VTE and death. Bleeding was significantly reduced by NOACs: major bleeding by rivaroxaban (RR 0.55; 0.38 - 0.81) and apixaban (RR 0.31; 0.17 - 0.55); major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding by dabigatran (RR 0.63; 0.51 - 0.77), apixaban (RR 0.44; 0.36 - 0.55) and edoxaban (RR 0.81; 0.71 - 0.93). The ARR for major bleeding was 1 % for rivaroxaban and apixaban; and for the composite bleeding endpoint 3.2 % for dabigatran, 5.4 % for apixaban, and 1.9 % for edoxaban. Regarding efficacy, no differences were found between NOACs. Apixaban reduced incidence of major bleeding more than dabigatran and edoxaban. Regarding occurrence of the composite bleeding endpoint, apixaban performed better than all other NOACs and dabigatran better than rivaroxaban and edoxaban. CONCLUSIONS: NOACs are as efficient in the treatment of VTE as VKA but with reduced risk of bleeding complications. Indirect comparisons indicate differences in the risk of clinically relevant bleeding events. Important issues such as monitoring and reversal of anticoagulation are still unresolved, but introduction of NOACs increased the therapeutic spectrum and thereby the potential for individualized therapy.			2014				3560
Screening for Vitamin D Deficiency: A Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force		LeBlanc, E. S., Zakher, B., Daeges, M., Pappas, M. and Chou, R.				annals of internal medicine	annals of internal medicine	BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with adverse health outcomes. PURPOSE: To systematically review benefits and harms of vitamin D screening in asymptomatic adults. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE (through the third week of August 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials of screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency and case-control studies nested within the Women's Health Initiative. DATA EXTRACTION: One investigator abstracted data, a second reviewed data for accuracy, and 2 investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: No study examined the effects of vitamin D screening versus no screening on clinical outcomes. Vitamin D treatment was associated with decreased mortality versus placebo or no treatment (11 studies; risk ratio [RR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99]), although benefits were no longer seen after trials of institutionalized persons were excluded (8 studies; RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.73 to 1.18]). Vitamin D treatment was associated with possible decreased risk for having at least 1 fall (5 studies; RR, 0.84 [CI, 0.69 to 1.02]) and falls per person (5 studies; incidence rate ratio, 0.66 [CI, 0.50 to 0.88]) but not fractures (5 studies; RR, 0.98 [CI, 0.82 to 1.16]). Vitamin D treatment was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk for serious adverse events (RR, 1.17 [CI, 0.74 to 1.84]). LIMITATION: Variability across studies in 25-hydroxyvitamin D assays and baseline levels, treatment doses, use of calcium, and duration of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Treatment of vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic persons might reduce mortality risk in institutionalized elderly persons and risk for falls but not fractures.

Timing of rebleeding in high-risk peptic ulcer bleeding after successful hemostasis: a systematic review		El Ouali, S., Barkun, A., Martel, M. and Maggio, D.				canadian journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	canadian journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	BACKGROUND: Peptic ulcer rebleeding (PUR) usually occurs within three days following endoscopic hemostasis. However, recent data have increasingly suggested delayed rebleeding. ? OBJECTIVE: To better characterize the timing of PUR (Forrest Ia to IIb) following initially successful endoscopic hemostasis. ? METHODS: An exhaustive literature search (1989 to 2013), with cross-referencing, was performed to identify pertinent randomized controlled trial (RCT) arms. Patients receiving high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion following successful modern-day endoscopic hemostasis were included. A sensitivity analysis included any patients receiving PPI doses >40 mg daily. The main outcome measure was 30-day rebleeding, while weighted mean averages at t = three, seven, 14 and 28 to 30 days are also reported. RESULTS: Of 756 citations, six RCTs were included (561 patients; 58.5% to 89.5% male; 55.3 to 67.5 years of age). Among patients receiving high-dose PPI (five RCTs [393 patients]), 11.5% (95% CI 8.4% to 14.7%) experienced rebleeding, 55.6% (95% CI 41.1% to 70.1%) rebled within three days, 20% (95% CI 8.3% to 31.7%) between four and seven days, 17.8% (95% CI 6.6% to 28.9%) at eight to 14 days, and 6.7% (95% CI 0% to 14%) at 15 to 28 to 30 days. Using the relaxed lower PPI dosing threshold, similar respective rates were 14.4% (95% CI 11.5% to 17.3%) overall, with interval rates of 39.5% (95% CI 28.9% to 50.15%), 34.6% (95% CI 24.2% to 44.9%), 19.7% (95% CI 11% to 28.4%) and 6.2% (95% CI 0.95% to 11.5%). Qualitative review of patient characteristics, limited by small sample size, possible bias and study heterogeneity, suggested increased patient comorbidity and postendoscopic use of lower PPI dosing may predict delayed rebleeding. ? CONCLUSION: In patients with high-risk PUR undergoing successful endoscopic hemostasis, most rebled within three days, with many experiencing later rebleeding. Additional research is needed to better predict such an outcome.			2014				3387
Treating nonsuicidal self-injury: a systematic review of psychological and pharmacological interventions		Turner, B. J., Austin, S. B. and Chapman, A. L.				canadian journal of psychiatry. revue canadienne de psychiatrie	canadian journal of psychiatry. revue canadienne de psychiatrie	OBJECTIVE: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), the deliberate, self-inflicted damage of bodily tissue without the intent to die, is associated with various negative outcomes. Although basic and epidemiologic research on NSSI has increased during the last 2 decades, literature on effective interventions targeting NSSI is still emerging. Here, we present a comprehensive, systematic review of existing psychological and pharmacological treatments designed specifically for NSSI, or including outcome assessments examining change in NSSI. METHOD: We conducted a systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ERIC databases to retrieve relevant articles that met inclusion criteria; specifically, uncontrolled and controlled trials that 1) presented quantitative outcome data on NSSI, and 2) clearly differentiated NSSI from suicidal self-injury (SSI). Consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, definition of NSSI, we excluded studies examining populations with developmental or intellectual disabilities, or with psychotic disorders. RESULTS: Several interventions appear to hold promise for reducing NSSI, including dialectical behaviour therapy, emotion regulation group therapy, manual-assisted cognitive therapy, dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy, atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole), naltrexone, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (with or without cognitive-behavioural therapy). Nevertheless, there remains a paucity of well-controlled studies investigating treatment efficacy for NSSI. CONCLUSIONS: Structured psychotherapeutic approaches focusing on collaborative therapeutic relationships, motivation for change, and directly addressing NSSI behaviours seem to be most effective in reducing NSSI. Medications targeting the serotonergic, dopaminergic and opioid systems also have demonstrated some benefits. Future studies employing controlled designs as well as a clear delineation of NSSI and SSI will improve knowledge regarding treatment effects.			2014				2788
Systematic review with meta-analysis: the effects of rifaximin in hepatic encephalopathy		Kimer, N., Krag, A., Møller, S., Bendtsen, F. and Gluud, L. L.				alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	BACKGROUND: Rifaximin is recommended for prevention of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). The effects of rifaximin on overt and minimal HE are debated. AIM: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on rifaximin for HE. METHODS: We performed electronic and manual searches, gathered information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Home Page, and obtained unpublished information on trial design and outcome measures from authors and pharmaceutical companies. Meta-analyses were performed and results presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the number needed to treat. Subgroup, sensitivity, regression and sequential analyses were performed to evaluate the risk of bias and sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs with 1370 patients. Outcomes were recalculated based on unpublished information of 11 trials. Overall, rifaximin had a beneficial effect on secondary prevention of HE (RR: 1.32; 95% CI 1.06-1.65), but not in a sensitivity analysis on rifaximin after TIPSS (RR: 1.27; 95% CI 1.00-1.53). Rifaximin increased the proportion of patients who recovered from HE (RR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.46-0.76) and reduced mortality (RR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.97). The results were robust to adjustments for bias control. No small study effects were identified. The sequential analyses only confirmed the results of the analysis on HE recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin has a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy and may reduce mortality. The combined evidence suggests that rifaximin may be considered in the evidence-based management of hepatic encephalopathy.			2014				2910
Pharmacotherapy of trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder): an updated systematic review		Rothbart, R. and Stein, D. J.				expert opinion on pharmacotherapy	expert opinion on pharmacotherapy	INTRODUCTION: Individuals affected by trichotillomania (TTM) (hair-pulling disorder) consciously or non-consciously pull out their own body hair. The disorder has recently been incorporated into a chapter entitled, 'Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders' in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition. AREAS COVERED: The review describes the literature currently available on the pharmacotherapy for TTM, including both randomized controlled trials and open-label trials of pharmacotherapy for TTM in adults or children. EXPERT OPINION: Early work focused on the serotonin reuptake inhibitors; however, the majority of the trials have been negative. There is a small body of evidence focused on pharmacotherapy for TTM. In future, larger trials are required to expand on the preliminary evidence available for N-acetylcysteine, olanzapine and dronabinol in recent trials.			2014				3310
Effectiveness of Diabetes Prevention Program translations among African Americans		Samuel-Hodge, C. D., Johnson, C. M., Braxton, D. F. and Lackey, M.				obesity reviews : an official journal of the international association for the study of obesity	obesity reviews : an official journal of the international association for the study of obesity	The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated risk reduction for incident diabetes through weight loss among all participants, including African Americans. Several DPP translations have been conducted in less controlled settings, including primary care practices and communities; however, there is no detailed compilation of how effective these translations have been for African Americans. This systematic literature review evaluated DPP translations from 2003 to 2012. Eligible records were retrieved using a search strategy of relevant databases and gray literature. Retrieved records (n=1,272) were screened using a priori criteria, which resulted in 21 full-text studies for review. Seventeen studies were included in the full-text qualitative synthesis. Seven studies had 100% African American samples and 10 studies had mixed samples with African American subgroups. African American participants' average weight loss was roughly half of that achieved in the DPP intervention. However, with few higher-quality studies, small sample sizes and differences in intervention designs and implementation, comparisons across interventions were difficult. The suboptimal effectiveness of DPP translations among African American adults, particularly women, signals the need for enhancements to existing evidence-based interventions and more high-quality research that includes other at-risk African American subgroups such as men and younger adults of lower socioeconomic status.			2014				3768
Medical utilization of kiosks in the delivery of patient education: a systematic review		Yvonne Chan, Y. F., Nagurka, R., Bentley, S., Ordonez, E. and Sproule, W.				health promotion perspectives	health promotion perspectives	BACKGROUND: The utilization of kiosks has previously been shown to be effective for collecting information, delivering educational modules, and providing access to health information. We discuss a review of current literature for the utilization of kiosks for the delivery of patient education. METHODS: The criteria for inclusion in this literature review were: (1) study discusses the utilization of kiosks for patient health education; (2) study discusses the use of touch screens for patient health information; (3) published in English. Our review includes searches via MEDLINE databases and Google Scholar for the years 1996-2014. RESULTS: Overall, 167 articles were screened for final eligibility, and after discarding duplicates and non-eligible studies with abstract. Full-text review of 28 articles was included in the final analysis. CONCLUSION: The review of available literature demonstrates the effectiveness of touch screen kiosks to educate patients and to improve healthcare, both at a performance and cost advantage over other modes of patient education.			2014				3490
Measuring situation awareness in emergency settings: a systematic review of tools and outcomes		Cooper, S., Porter, J. and Peach, L.				open access emergency medicine : oaem	open access emergency medicine : oaem	BACKGROUND: Nontechnical skills have an impact on health care outcomes and improve patient safety. Situation awareness is core with the view that an understanding of the environment will influence decision-making and performance. This paper reviews and describes indirect and direct measures of situation awareness applicable for emergency settings. METHODS: Electronic databases and search engines were searched from 1980 to 2010, including CINAHL, Ovid Medline, Pro-Quest, Cochrane, and the search engine, Google Scholar. Access strategies included keyword, author, and journal searches. Publications identified were assessed for relevance, and analyzed and synthesized using Oxford evidence levels and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme guidelines in order to assess their quality and rigor. RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen papers were initially identified, and reduced to 55 following title and abstract review. The final selection included 14 papers drawn from the fields of emergency medicine, intensive care, anesthetics, and surgery. Ten of these discussed four general nontechnical skill measures (including situation awareness) and four incorporated the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique. CONCLUSION: A range of direct and indirect techniques for measuring situation awareness is available. In the medical literature, indirect approaches are the most common, with situation awareness measured as part of a nontechnical skills assessment. In simulation-based studies, situation awareness in emergencies tends to be suboptimal, indicating the need for improved training techniques to enhance awareness and improve decision-making.			2014				3360
Coronary revascularization in diabetic patients: a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis		Tu, B., Rich, B., Labos, C. and Brophy, J. M.				annals of internal medicine	annals of internal medicine	BACKGROUND: The optimal revascularization technique in diabetic patients is an important unresolved question. PURPOSE: To compare long-term outcomes between the revascularization techniques of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). DATA SOURCES: English-language publications in PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid, and EMBASE between 1 January 1990 and 1 June 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Two investigators independently reviewed randomized, controlled trials comparing PCI (with drug-eluting or bare-metal stents) with CABG in adults with diabetes with multivessel or left main coronary artery disease. DATA EXTRACTION: Study design, quality, patient characteristics, length of follow-up, and outcomes were extracted. For duplicate publications, outcomes were obtained from the publication with the longest follow-up. DATA SYNTHESIS: 40 studies were combined using a Bayesian network meta-analysis that accounted for the variation in stent choice. The primary outcome, a composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke, increased with PCI (odds ratio [OR], 1.33 [95% credible interval {CrI}, 1.01 to 1.65]). Percutaneous coronary intervention resulted in increased mortality (OR, 1.44 [CrI, 1.05 to 1.91]), no change in the number of myocardial infarctions (OR, 1.33 [CrI, 0.86 to 1.95]), and fewer strokes (OR, 0.56 [CrI, 0.36 to 0.88]). LIMITATIONS: Study design and length of follow-up were heterogeneous, and results were driven primarily by a single study. Costs and nonvascular complications of the interventions were not examined. CONCLUSION: Coronary artery bypass grafting seems to be the preferred revascularization technique in diabetics, especially if long-term survival is anticipated. However, because of residual uncertainties and increased risk for stroke with CABG, clinical judgment is required when choosing a revascularization technique in patients with diabetes.

Timing of (supplemental) parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients: a systematic review		Bost, R. B., Tjan, D. H. and van Zanten, A. R.				annals of intensive care	annals of intensive care	Supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN) is used in a step-up approach when full enteral support is contraindicated or fails to reach caloric targets. Recent nutrition guidelines present divergent advices regarding timing of SPN in critically ill patients ranging from early SPN (<48 h after admission; EPN) to postponing initiation of SPN until day 8 after Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (LPN). This systematic review summarizes results of prospective studies among adult ICU patients addressing the best timing of (supplemental) parenteral nutrition (S)PN. A structured PubMed search was conducted to identify eligible articles. Articles were screened and selected using predetermined criteria and appraised for relevance and validity. After critical appraisal, four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two prospective observational studies remained. One RCT found a higher percentage of alive discharge from the ICU at day 8 in the LPN group compared to EPN group (p?=?0.007) but no differences in ICU and in-hospital mortality. None of the other RCTs found differences in ICU or in-hospital mortality rates. Contradicting or divergent results on other secondary outcomes were found for ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, infection rates, nutrition targets, duration of mechanical ventilation, glucose control, duration of renal replacement therapy, muscle wasting and fat loss. Although the heterogeneity in quality and design of relevant studies precludes firm conclusions, it is reasonable to assume that in adult critically ill patients, there are no clinically relevant benefits of EPN compared with LPN with respect to morbidity or mortality end points, when full enteral support is contraindicated or fails to reach caloric targets. However, considering that infectious morbidity and resolution of organ failure may be negatively affected through mechanisms not yet clearly understood and acquisition costs of parenteral nutrition are higher, the early administration of parenteral nutrition cannot be recommended.			2014				2980
Everolimus-based calcineurin-inhibitor sparing regimens for kidney transplant recipients: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Su, L., Tam, N., Deng, R., Chen, P., Li, H. and Wu, L.				international urology and nephrology	international urology and nephrology	PURPOSE: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) associated nephrotoxicity remains a risk factor for long-term graft dysfunction after renal transplantation. Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor and exhibits synergistic immunosuppressive activity with CNI to permit CNI-reduction. We conducted a systematic review to compare the efficacy of everolimus-based CNI sparing and standard CNI regimens in renal transplantation recipients. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases to identify relevant randomized controlled trials. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), death or graft loss and incidence of adverse events were the major estimates of renal function, efficacy, and tolerability of the two regimens. RESULTS: Seven studies providing data for 2,067 patients were included. Six of the seven studies used cyclosporine as the CNI. The patients were divided into two groups: everolimus-based CNI sparing (elimination and minimization) group and standard CNI group. Everolimus-based regimen was associated with increased GFR [P = 0.02; weighted mean difference (WMD) 4.83 mL/min], decreased serum creatinine (P = 0.004; WMD -9.94 ?mol/L) and no more death or graft loss [P = 0.72; relative risk (RR) 1.07]. CNI-minimization was not associated with increased BPAR (P = 0.25; RR 0.85) while CNI-elimination was associated with more BPAR Grade 1 (P < 0.00001; RR 4.20). Use of everolimus reduced the risk of CMV infection (P = 0.0002; RR 0.47). There was a higher risk of discontinuation of everolimus (P < 0.00001; RR 1.69) and non-fatal adverse events (P < 0.00001; RR 1.73) in patients on the everolimus based CNI sparing regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus-based CNI sparing regimen could optimize long-term graft function without leading to more death or graft loss. Although CNI elimination was associated with higher risk of BPAR, everolimus use with CNI minimization did not increase the risk of acute rejections. Use of everolimus was associated with reduction in the incidence of CMV infection, but there was a higher risk of discontinuation of this drug and other non-fatal adverse events.			2014				2978
Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery Versus Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Versus Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy for Treatment of Lower Pole Renal Stones: A Meta-analysis and Systematic Review		Zhang, W., Zhou, T., Wu, T., Gao, X., Peng, Y., Xu, C., Chen, Q., Song, R. and Sun, Y.				journal of endourology / endourological society	journal of endourology / endourological society	Background: The optimal treatment of lower pole renal stones continues to be a dilemma for urologists. Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) all constitute viable therapeutic options in selected patients. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of RIRS, PCNL and ESWL in management of lower pole renal stones. Methods: A literature search was performed in July 2014 using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Literature reviewed included meta-analysis and randomized and nonrandomized controlled studies to identify relevant studies for the meta-analysis. Results: Six randomized and eight nonrandomized studies were identified for analysis. PCNL provided a significantly higher stone-free rate (SFR) compared with RIRS and ESWL. Furthermore, no statistical significant difference was found when PCNL was compared with RIRS and ESWL for complication rate. Compared to the other two treatments, RIRS had longer operative time and PCNL had longer hospital stay. ESWL was associated with significantly higher retreatment rate compared to RIRS and PCNL, whereas there were no significant differences in auxiliary procedure rates among the three treatment techniques. Conclusion: RIRS offers a relative higher SFR while has a longer operative time. PCNL is associated with the highest SFR at the expense of the longest hospital stay. ESWL is performed as an outpatient procedure with a relative shorter operative time, however, it has lower SFR and higher retreatment rate. The categories of complications vary while the overall complication rates are comparable among the three treatment techniques.			2015				9971
Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease: a meta-analysis of 19 studies		Covic, A., Nistor, I., Donciu, M. D., Dumea, R., Bolignano, D. and Goldsmith, D.				american journal of nephrology	american journal of nephrology	BACKGROUND: The effect of anemia correction on kidney function in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients remains unclear. As 19-40% of patients with CKD receive an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), this is a potentially important consideration. SUMMARY: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials to January 1, 2014 in adult patients with CKD stages 1 to 4. SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: randomized controlled trials of at least 2 months duration. Patients were allocated to ESA versus placebo, no treatment, or different ESA doses with the purpose of achieving a higher versus a lower hemoglobin target. The analyzed outcomes were the need for renal replacement therapy, doubling of serum creatinine, change in GFR (ml/min), mortality and withdrawal of treatment due to adverse events. A total of 19 trials (n = 8,129 participants with CKD stage 1-4) were reviewed. There was no difference in the risk of end-stage kidney disease (RR, 0.97 [CI 0.83-1.20], 17 trials, 8,104 participants), change in GFR (Mean Difference [MD] -0.45 [-2.21, 1.31], 9 trials, 1,848 participants) or withdrawal of treatment due to adverse events (RR, 1.18 [CI 0.77-1.81], 10 trials, n = 1,958 participants) for patients at higher hemoglobin (Hb) targets. Furthermore, no statistically significant differences in mortality (Risk Ratio [RR] 1.10 [CI 0.90-1.35], 16 trials, n = 8,082 participants) were observed. Key Messages: There is no evidence that ESA treatment affects renal function in patients with CKD. Use of these agents should not therefore be influenced by considerations about influencing CKD progression.			2014				4017
Bortezomib in multiple myeloma: systematic review and clinical considerations		Kouroukis, T. C., Baldassarre, F. G., Haynes, A. E., Imrie, K., Reece, D. E. and Cheung, M. C.				current oncology (toronto, ont.)	current oncology (toronto, ont.)	We conducted a systematic review to determine the appropriate use of bortezomib alone or in combination with other agents in patients with multiple myeloma (mm). We searched medline, embase, the Cochrane Library, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of included studies. We analyzed randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews if they involved adult mm patients treated with bortezomib and if they reported on survival, disease control, response, quality of life, or adverse effects. Twenty-six unique studies met the inclusion criteria. For patients with previously untreated mm and for candidates for transplantation, we found a statistically significant benefit in time to progression [hazard ratio (hr): 0.48, p < 0.001; and hr: 0.63, p = 0.006, respectively] and a better response with a bortezomib than with a non-bortezomib regimen (p < 0.001). Progression-free survival was longer with bortezomib and thalidomide than with thalidomide alone (p = 0.01). In non-candidates for transplantation, a significant benefit in overall survival was observed with a bortezomib regimen (hr compared with a non-bortezomib regimen: 0.61; p = 0.008), and in transplantation candidates receiving bortezomib, the response rate was improved after induction (p = 0.004) and after a first transplant (p = 0.016). In relapsed or refractory mm, overall survival (p = 0.03), time to progression (hr: 1.82; p = 0.000004), and progression-free survival (hr: 1.69; p = 0.000026) were significantly improved with bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (compared with bortezomib alone), and bortezomib monotherapy was better than dexamethasone alone (hr: 0.77; p = 0.027). Bortezomib combined with thalidomide and dexamethasone was better than either bortezomib monotherapy or thalidomide with dexamethasone (p < 0.001). In previously untreated or in relapsed or refractory mm patients, bortezomib-based therapy has improved disease control and, in some patients, overall survival.			2014				2680
Safety and efficacy of therapies for skin symptoms of psoriasis in patients with psoriatic arthritis: a systematic review		Boehncke, W. H., Alvarez Martinez, D., Solomon, J. A. and Gottlieb, A. B.				the journal of rheumatology	the journal of rheumatology	Numerous guidelines and recommendations exist for the treatment of psoriasis in various populations. One important population is patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who have symptoms of both joint and skin disease. In patients with both facets of psoriatic disease, skin and joints must be treated separately, but also simultaneously. As several systemic therapies are approved for either one or both, the concept of treating both facets with the same drug is feasible. This review summarizes evidence from studies in patients with PsA on the efficacy of these drugs on psoriatic skin disease in these patients.			2014				3575
The effects of whole body vibration on mobility and balance in Parkinson disease: a systematic review		Sharififar, S., Coronado, R. A., Romero, S., Azari, H. and Thigpen, M.				iranian journal of medical sciences	iranian journal of medical sciences	Whole body vibration (WBV) is a contemporary treatment modality that holds promise as an exercise training method in health-compromised individuals. A growing number of studies on individuals with Parkinson Disease are examining whether WBV improves balance and functional mobility. However, interpreting WBV studies is challenging since there is variability in the manner in which WBV intervention is conducted. The primary goal of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of WBV on improving mobility and balance as measured by a battery of clinical tests, in patients with Parkinson disease. Studies based on WBV parameters were characterized and a systematic search of peer-reviewed literature in five major databases was conducted. Randomized-controlled trials investigating the effects of WBV in patients with a Parkinson diagnosis and no cognitive impairment were included. A total of six publications met the inclusion criteria. Overall, studies demonstrated mixed results in favor of WBV for improving balance or mobility. The majority of studies seem to suggest a favorable benefit following WBV for mobility and balance, but not when compared to other active intervention or placebo. There was variability in the manner in which WBV intervention was applied. Variations among the six studies included: duration of intervention and rest, follow-up period, type of control groups, frequency of vibration, number of treatment sessions and sex distribution of subjects. Future research is needed to investigate the effects of different types of equipment and treatment dosage in individuals with Parkinson disease.			2014				2786
Pharmacologic agents for the prevention and treatment of delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: systematic review and metaanalysis*		Mu, J. L., Lee, A. and Joynt, G. M.				critical care medicine	critical care medicine	OBJECTIVES: Postcardiac surgery delirium is associated with increased risks of morbidity, cognitive decline, poor health-related quality of life and mortality, and higher healthcare costs. We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to examine the effect of pharmacologic agents for the prevention and the treatment of delirium after cardiac surgery. DATA SOURCES: Electronic search on PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ISI Web of Science, and CINAHL up to December 2013. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic agents used for the prevention and the treatment of delirium after emergency or elective cardiac surgery in adults. DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted data on patient population, pharmacologic agents, delirium characteristics, rescue treatment, length of stays in the ICU and hospital, and mortality. For each trial, we assessed the risk of bias domains and rated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 13 studies (10 prevention and three treatment) involving 5,848 patients, one multicentered randomized controlled trial on prophylactic dexamethasone made up 77% of the total sample size. The use of pharmacologic agents (dexamethasone, rivastigmine, risperidone, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, propofol, and clonidine) reduced the risk of delirium (relative risk, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40-0.80) with quality of evidence rated as moderate. There was high quality of evidence for no increased risk of mortality (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.57-1.38) associated with the use of prophylactic pharmacologic agents. Metaanalysis of treatment trials was not undertaken because of high heterogeneity. In two small trials (total number of patients = 133), haloperidol did not appear to be effective in treating delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to high-quality evidence supports the use of pharmacologic agents for the prevention of delirium, but results are based largely on one randomized controlled trial. The evidence for treating postcardiac surgery delirium with pharmacologic agents is inconclusive.			2015				7780

Alcohol screening and brief intervention in workplace settings and social services: a comparison of literature		Schulte, B., O'Donnell, A. J., Kastner, S., Schmidt, C. S., Schäfer, I. and Reimer, J.				frontiers in psychiatry	frontiers in psychiatry	BACKGROUND: The robust evidence base for the effectiveness of alcohol screening and brief interventions (ASBIs) in primary health care (PHC) suggests that a widespread expansion of ASBI in non-medical settings could be beneficial. Social service and criminal justice settings work frequently with persons with alcohol use disorders, and workplace settings can be an appropriate setting for the implementation of alcohol prevention programs, as a considerable part of their social interactions takes place in this context. METHODS: Update of two systematic reviews on ASBI effectiveness in workplaces, social service, and criminal justice settings. Review to identify implementation barriers and facilitators and future research needs of ASBI in non-medical settings. RESULTS: We found a limited number of randomized controlled trials in non-medical settings with an equivocal evidence of effectiveness of ASBI. In terms of barriers and facilitators to implementation, the heterogeneity of non-medical settings makes it challenging to draw overarching conclusions. In the workplace, employee concerns with regard to the consequences of self-disclosure appear to be key. For social services, the complexity of certain client needs suggest that a stepped and carefully tailored approach is likely to be required. DISCUSSION: Compared to PHC, the reviewed settings are far more heterogeneous in terms of client groups, external conditions, and the focus on substance use disorders. Thus, future research should try to systematize these differences, and consider their implications for the deliverability, acceptance, and potential effectiveness of ASBI for different target groups, organizational frameworks, and professionals.			2014				3883
Effects and safety of iron-based phosphate binders in dialysis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Zhai, C. J., Yu, X. S., Yang, X. W., Sun, J. and Wang, R.				renal failure	renal failure	Aim: To assess the effects and safety of iron-based phosphate binders in adult patients receiving dialysis. METHODS: We electronically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and CBM for randomized controlled trials about iron-based phosphate binders in adult dialysis patients. Study quality was assessed using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of intervention. Meta-analysis was conducted by RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Eight studies with 2018 participants were eligible for our meta-analysis. Iron-based phosphate binders were superior to placebo (MD?=?-2.43?mg/dL, 95% CI: -3.18 to -1.68, p?<?0.00001) and as efficient as sevelamer (MD?=?0.04?mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.29 to 0.36, p?=?0.83) in reducing serum phosphorus in dialysis patients. No significant differences were found in all adverse events (OR?=?1.30, 95% CI: 0.77 to 2.20, p?=?0.32) between iron-based phosphate binders and placebo. Iron-based phosphate binders were associated with significant higher serum iron (MD?=?9.39?ng/mL, 95% CI 1.48 to 17.30, p?=?0.02), higher serum transferring saturation (MD?=?6.29%, 95% CI 2.72 to 9.87, p?=?0.0006) and lower serum total iron binding capacity (MD?=?-23.13?µg/dL, 95% CI -35.69 to -10.58, p?=?0.0003) in comparison to placebo. CONCLUSION: Iron-based phosphate binders are as effective as sevelamer and well tolerated for hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients. Iron-based phosphate binders appear to have a beneficial effect on renal anemia in patients receiving dialysis. Therefore, iron-based phosphate binders may represent a new treatment option for dialysis patients.			2015				9231
Branched-chain amino acid supplementation in adults with cirrhosis and porto-systemic encephalopathy: systematic review		Metcalfe, E. L., Avenell, A. and Fraser, A.				clinical nutrition (edinburgh, scotland)	clinical nutrition (edinburgh, scotland)	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Branched-chain amino acid supplementation in porto-systemic encephalopathy remains controversial. Here, we examined the systematic review evidence for their effect on encephalopathy, hepatic decompensation, survival, infection, hospital stay and quality of life, and review data on adherence, side-effects and cost/economic evaluation. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched from 1980 to June 2011, with an update search in two databases in July 2013. Hand-searching was performed of references lists from included trials and six conference proceedings from 2005 to 2010. We included randomised controlled trials of branched chain amino acids versus other nutritional supplements in adults with cirrhosis and porto-systemic encephalopathy. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent assessors. Meta-analysis was performed if data were sufficient. RESULTS: The search identified nine randomised controlled trials (436 patients in total) of branched-chain amino acid therapy for ?2 weeks' duration. The overall quality of trials was poor. At meta-analysis, a significant improvement in the grade of encephalopathy was demonstrated in favour of branched-chain amino acids compared to other nutritional supplements (Risk Ratio 2.6, 95% Confidence Interval 1.7-3.9, p < 0.001, 2 trials, n 122) but no significant difference was found for either resolution or worsening of encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, survival or infection. Limited data suggested no difference in health-related quality of life, ascites or admission to hospital. Studies did not include cost data or economic evaluations. Side-effects appeared mild and gastrointestinal in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Branched-chain amino acids might improve porto-systemic encephalopathy but more robust trials are needed to determine their role.			2014				2837
A qualitative synthesis of the evidence behind elective lymph node irradiation in oesophageal cancer		Van De Voorde, L., Larue, R. T., Pijls, M., Buijsen, J., Troost, E. G., Berbée, M., Sosef, M., van Elmpt, W., Schraepen, M. C., Vanneste, B., Oellers, M. and Lambin, P.				radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the european society for therapeutic radiology and oncology	radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the european society for therapeutic radiology and oncology	Background and purpose: Oesophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide and radiotherapy plays a prominent role in its treatment. The presence of lymph node (LN) metastasis has been demonstrated to be one of the most significant prognostic factors related to oesophageal cancer. The use of elective lymph node irradiation (ENI) is still a topic of persistent controversy. The conservative school is to irradiate positive lymph nodes only; the other school is to prophylactically irradiate the regional lymph node area according to different tumour sites. This review investigated the justification for including ENI in the treatment of patients with oesophageal cancer. Material and methods: We performed a systematic literature search to find surgical data about lymph node distribution depending on different tumour subgroups: early, cervical, thoracic and gastroesophageal junction cancer. Furthermore, we performed a qualitative assessment of recurrence patterns in patients treated with or without ENI to derive estimates of the potential area at risk for lymph node harvest. Results: We identified and reviewed 49 studies: 10 in early, 8 in cervical, 10 in thoracic and the remaining 21 in gastroesophageal junction cancer. In general, these studies were conclusive in incidence and location of pathologic lymph nodes for different subgroups. Data for lymph node recurrence patterns are scarce and contributed little to our review. Conclusions: This review resulted in five recommendations for radiation oncologists in daily practice. We used the available evidence about metastatic lymph node distribution to develop a careful reasonable radiation protocol for the corresponding tumour subgroups.			2014				3718
Family therapy with sexual minority youths: A systematic review		Woodward, Eva N. and Willoughby, Brian				journal of glbt family studies	journal of glbt family studies	There is no consensus about best practices for therapy with sexual minority youths and their families because (1) information is scattered across years (19872013) and (2) a breadth of therapeutic orientations is represented. This article systematically reviews and synthesizes all existing work to present cohesive guidelines for therapists. Research databases were searched for articles published through June 2013 that reported on any common issues, strategies, or research findings for family therapy in which a young person has adopted a sexual minority identity or reported same-sex attractions, and the focus was explicitly on disclosure of same-sex orientation.Fifteen studies (12 clinical writing articles and 3 articles with outcome data) that reported on issues or recommendations for therapy were evaluated. The authors categorized recommendations into two areas: treatment logistics (e.g., session structure and type) and therapeutic content issues (e.g., parental meaning to coming out). There is considerable variation in recommendations for therapy with sexual minority youths and families, and 20% of it has been empirically evaluated. The consensus is that neither parents nor youths are blamed for same-sex orientation, and are utilized as resources for each other instead, using specific strategies delineated in the review.

Positive pressure therapy for Meniere's syndrome/ disease with a Meniett device: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials		Syed, M. I., Rutka, J., Hendry, J. and Browning, G. G.				clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ent-uk ; official journal of netherlands society for oto-rhino-laryngology & cervico-facial surgery	clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ent-uk ; official journal of netherlands society for oto-rhino-laryngology & cervico-facial surgery	BACKGROUND: Incidence rates of Meniere's syndrome/ disease/syndrome vary considerably from 157 per 100,000 in the United Kingdom to 15 per 100,000 in the United States. A wide range of treatments are used for the treatment of the condition with no consensus on the most effective intervention. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of the Meniett device in reducing the frequency and severity of vertigo in Meniere's syndrome/ disease SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials were searched. The date of the last search was 13(th) May 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that compared the efficacy of the Meniett device versus a placebo device in patients with Meniere's 'disease' as defined by the AAOO criterion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. The outcome data were dichotomous for all the included trials. MAIN RESULTS: The four RCTs compared 123 patients with the Meniett device against 114 patients with the placebo device from four RCT's over a follow up period of 2 weeks to four months. There was a significant overall 61% reduction in the frequency of vertigo in both groups [mean no vertigo days per month of 8 to 3]. However, this reduction was not significantly different between the two groups in any study or on meta-analysis [mean difference in vertigo free days between Meniett and placebo device of 0.77 days over a 1 m period (95% CI -0.82, 1.83) p=0.45]. There was also no substantive data to support a greater reduction in the severity of the vertigo or any other outcome with the Meniett device compared with the placebo device. AUTHORS CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found to justify the use of the Meniett device in Meniere's syndrome/ disease. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.			2015				9565
Exercise for lower limb osteoarthritis: systematic review incorporating trial sequential analysis and network meta-analysis		Uthman, O. A., van der Windt, D. A., Jordan, J. L., Dziedzic, K. S., Healey, E. L., Peat, G. M. and Foster, N. E.				british journal of sports medicine	british journal of sports medicine	"STUDY QUESTION: Which types of exercise intervention are most effective in relieving pain and improving function in people with lower limb osteoarthritis? SUMMARY ANSWER: As of 2002 sufficient evidence had accumulated to show significant benefit of exercise over no exercise. An approach combining exercises to increase strength, flexibility, and aerobic capacity is most likely to be effective for relieving pain and improving function. WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Current international guidelines recommend therapeutic exercise (land or water based) as ""core"" and effective management of osteoarthritis. Evidence from this first network meta-analysis, largely based on studies in knee osteoarthritis, indicates that an intervention combining strengthening exercises with flexibility and aerobic exercise is most likely to improve outcomes of pain and function. Further trials of exercise versus no exercise are unlikely to overturn this positive result."			2014				3446
Vaginal estrogen for genitourinary syndrome of menopause: a systematic review		Rahn, D. D., Carberry, C., Sanses, T. V., Mamik, M. M., Ward, R. M., Meriwether, K. V., Olivera, C. K., Abed, H., Balk, E. M., Murphy, M. and for the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons Systematic Review, Group				obstetrics and gynecology	obstetrics and gynecology	OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively review and critically assess the literature on vaginal estrogen and its alternatives for women with genitourinary syndrome of menopause and to provide clinical practice guidelines. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to April 2013. We included randomized controlled trials and prospective comparative studies. Interventions and comparators included all commercially available vaginal estrogen products. Placebo, no treatment, systemic estrogen (all routes), and nonhormonal moisturizers and lubricants were included as comparators. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We double-screened 1,805 abstracts, identifying 44 eligible studies. Discrepancies were adjudicated by a third reviewer. Studies were individually and collectively assessed for methodologic quality and strength of evidence. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Studies were extracted for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcomes data, including patient-reported atrophy symptoms (eg, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, dysuria, urgency, frequency, recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), and urinary incontinence), objective signs of atrophy, urodynamic measures, endometrial effects, serum estradiol changes, and adverse events. Compared with placebo, vaginal estrogens improved dryness, dyspareunia, urinary urgency, frequency, and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). Urinary tract infection rates decreased. The various estrogen preparations had similar efficacy and safety; serum estradiol levels remained within postmenopausal norms for all except high-dose conjugated equine estrogen cream. Endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma were extremely rare among those receiving vaginal estrogen. Comparing vaginal estrogen with nonhormonal moisturizers, patients with two or more symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy were substantially more improved using vaginal estrogens, but those with one or minor complaints had similar symptom resolution with either estrogen or nonhormonal moisturizer. CONCLUSION: All commercially available vaginal estrogens effectively relieve common vulvovaginal atrophy-related complaints and have additional utility in patients with urinary urgency, frequency or nocturia, SUI and UUI, and recurrent UTIs. Nonhormonal moisturizers are a beneficial alternative for those with few or minor atrophy-related symptoms and in patients at risk for estrogen-related neoplasia.

[Opioids in chronic noncancer pain-are opioids superior to nonopioid analgesics? : A systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy, tolerability and safety in randomized head-to-head comparisons of opioids versus nonopioid analgesics of at least four week's duration.]		Welsch, P., Sommer, C., Schiltenwolf, M. and Häuser, W.				schmerz (berlin, germany)	schmerz (berlin, germany)	"BACKGROUND: Some leading German pain medicine experts postulate that there is a type of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) with an opioid requirement. We tested whether opioids are superior to nonopioid analgesics in the management of CNCP in studies of at least 4 week's duration. METHODS: We screened MEDLINE, Scopus and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up until October 2013, as well as the reference sections of original studies and systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of opioids in CNCP. We included double-blind RTCs comparing opioids to nonopioid analgesics of at least 4 week's duration. Relative risks differences (RD) of categorical data and standardized mean differences (SMD) of continuous variables were calculated using a random effects model. RESULTS: We included 10 RCTs with 3046 participants. Median study duration was 6 weeks (range 4-12 weeks). Five studies compared tramadol with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in osteoarthritis pain and one trial compared tramadol to flupirtine in low back pain. Morphine was compared to antidepressants (two studies), an anticonvulsant (one study) and an antiarrhythmic (one study) in different neuropathic pain syndromes. There was no significant difference between opioids and nonopioid analgesics in pain reduction (SMD 0.03 [95?% confidence interval, CI -?0.18, 0.24]; p?=?0.76). Nonopioid analgesics were superior to opioids in improving physical function (SMD 0.17 [95?% CI 0.02, 0.32]; p?=?0.03). Patients dropped out due to adverse events more frequently with opioids than with nonopioid analgesics (RD 0.09 [95?% CI 0.06, 0.13]; p?<?0.0001). There was no significant difference between opioids and nonopioid analgesics in terms of serious adverse events or dropout rates due to lack of efficacy. CONCLUSION: Nonopioid analgesics are superior to opioids in terms of improvement of physical function and tolerability in short-term (4-12 weeks) therapy of neuropathic, low back and osteoarthritis pain. Our results do not support the concept of an""opioid-requiring"" CNCP. The English full-text version of this article is freely available at SpringerLink (under ""Supplemental"")."			2015				10179
Topical Cyclosporine A in the Treatment of Dry Eye: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Zhou, X. Q. and Wei, R. L.				cornea	cornea	PURPOSE: Cyclosporine A (CsA) is considered a potentially effective treatment for dry eye syndrome (DES), which is now one of the most common ocular problems whose exact mechanism is unknown. Because randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported to date have shown varying results in the efficacy and safety of CsA in different types of DES, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs on CsA versus placebo in treating DES to evaluate the treatment efficacy and safety of CsA. METHODS: We searched for RCTs published after 1990, in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The RCTs that were included compared topical CsA and placebo for DES treatment by evaluating scores of ocular surface disease index, tear break-up time, or Schirmer test. Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for assessing the risk of bias. RESULTS: We included 12 RCTs involving 3034 eyes of 1660 participants. We observed statistically significant improvements on scores of break-up time (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-1.46; I = 95%) and scores of Schirmer test with anesthesia (SMD, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.09-1.46; I = 97%) after treatment with topical CsA. Scores of ocular surface disease index (SMD, 0.77; 95% CI, -1.05 to 2.58; I = 98%) and scores of Schirmer test without anesthesia (SMD, 0.08; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.27; I = 0%) were not improved. Adverse events (odds ratio [OR], 1.61; 95% CI, 1.28-2.02; I = 21%) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Topical CsA could be an effective treatment for DES, especially for DES associated with conjunctival injury. Further RCTs with larger sample sizes for different clinical types of DES are warranted to determine the efficacy and limitation for different clinical types of DES.			2014				2984
Psychological and pharmacological interventions for social anxiety disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis		Mayo-Wilson, E., Dias, S., Mavranezouli, I., Kew, K., Clark, D. M., Ades, A. E. and Pilling, S.				the lancet. psychiatry	the lancet. psychiatry	BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder-a chronic and naturally unremitting disease that causes substantial impairment-can be treated with pharmacological, psychological, and self-help interventions. We aimed to compare these interventions and to identify which are most effective for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults. METHODS: We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder, identified from published and unpublished sources between 1988 and Sept 13, 2013. We analysed interventions by class and individually. Outcomes were validated measures of social anxiety, reported as standardised mean differences (SMDs) compared with a waitlist reference. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012003146. FINDINGS: We included 101 trials (13?164 participants) of 41 interventions or control conditions (17 classes) in the analyses. Classes of pharmacological interventions that had greater effects on outcomes compared with waitlist were monoamine oxidase inhibitors (SMD -1·01, 95% credible interval [CrI] -1·56 to -0·45), benzodiazepines (-0·96, -1·56 to -0·36), selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs; -0·91, -1·23 to -0·60), and anticonvulsants (-0·81, -1·36 to -0·28). Compared with waitlist, efficacious classes of psychological interventions were individual cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT; SMD -1·19, 95% CrI -1·56 to -0·81), group CBT (-0·92, -1·33 to -0·51), exposure and social skills (-0·86, -1·42 to -0·29), self-help with support (-0·86, -1·36 to -0·36), self-help without support (-0·75, -1·25 to -0·26), and psychodynamic psychotherapy (-0·62, -0·93 to -0·31). Individual CBT compared with psychological placebo (SMD -0·56, 95% CrI -1·00 to -0·11), and SSRIs and SNRIs compared with pill placebo (-0·44, -0·67 to -0·22) were the only classes of interventions that had greater effects on outcomes than appropriate placebo. Individual CBT also had a greater effect than psychodynamic psychotherapy (SMD -0·56, 95% CrI -1·03 to -0·11) and interpersonal psychotherapy, mindfulness, and supportive therapy (-0·82, -1·41 to -0·24). INTERPRETATION: Individual CBT (which other studies have shown to have a lower risk of side-effects than pharmacotherapy) is associated with large effect sizes. Thus, it should be regarded as the best intervention for the initial treatment of social anxiety disorder. For individuals who decline psychological intervention, SSRIs show the most consistent evidence of benefit. FUNDING: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.			2014				3036
Atopic dermatitis: an evidence-based treatment update		Silverberg, J. I.				american journal of clinical dermatology	american journal of clinical dermatology	BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory disorder of skin with significant comorbidities. AD care often requires a combination of treatment approaches, including emollients, topical steroids, systemic immunosuppressants and/or phototherapy. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to review recent randomized controlled trials (RCT) and systematic reviews of AD treatments. METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed focusing on RCTs of AD treatments, with a sample size ? 15, and systematic reviews published from 2011 to 2013, limited to the English language. A total of 53 manuscripts met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, including 44 RCTs and nine systematic reviews. RESULTS: Investigator-initiated RCTs support the use of the systemic agents cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil. In one RCT, petrolatum was found to be as effective as creams containing ceramides or glycyrrhetinic acid. Additional therapeutic approaches supported by RCTs include balneotherapy, oral and/or topical probiotics, nutritional interventions, vitamin D with or without vitamin E supplementation, as well as several new topical and complementary medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Advances have been made with respect to AD treatment in the past few years through the use of well designed RCTs and comparative efficacy studies. However, more well designed RCTs and investigator-initiated studies are needed in order to improve the care of AD patients.			2014				3698
Laparoscopic appendicectomy in obese is associated with improvements in clinical outcome: Systematic review		Dasari, B. V., Baker, J., Markar, S. and Gardiner, K.				international journal of surgery (london, england)	international journal of surgery (london, england)	Background: Obese patients with general surgical emergencies provide unique challenges to the emergency surgical teams. Acute appendicitis is the most common adult acute surgical emergency encountered in practice. This systematic review evaluates the role of laparoscopic appendicectomy in obese by comparing the outcomes of laparoscopic appendicectomy in obese versus non-obese and the laparoscopic versus open appendicectomy in obese patients. Methods: Relevant comparative studies were identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and PubMed (1990-2013). Primary outcomes evaluated were mortality, overall morbidity and duration of surgery. Secondary outcomes evaluated were superficial (superficial wound infection) and deep surgical site infection (intra-abdominal abscesses), conversion to open surgery, and cost of the procedure. Results: Seven retrospective cohort studies and one prospective randomized controlled trial met the inclusion criteria. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary and secondary outcomes between the obese and non-obese patients undergoing laparoscopic appendicectomy. Laparoscopic appendicectomy in obese patients is associated with reduced mortality (risk ratio [RR]: 0.19 (95% CI 0.12-0.30), reduced overall morbidity (RR: 0.49 (95% CI: 0.47-0.51)), reduced superficial wound infections (RR: 0.27 (95% CI 0.21-0.35)), shorter operating times and post-operative length of hospital stay, compared to open appendicectomy. Methodological quality of the included studies is low. Conclusion: Laparoscopic appendicectomy appears to be a safer alternative approach to open surgery in obese adult patents. There is no significant difference in the outcomes between the obese and non-obese patients undergoing laparoscopic appendicectomy.			2015				6747
Lack of evidence for intravenous vasodilators in ED patients with acute heart failure: a systematic review		Alexander, P., Alkhawam, L., Curry, J., Levy, P., Pang, P. S., Storrow, A. B. and Collins, S. P.				the american journal of emergency medicine	the american journal of emergency medicine	There are nearly 700,000 annual US emergency department (ED) visits for acute heart failure (AHF). Although blood pressure is elevated on most of these visits, acute therapy remains focused on preload and not afterload reduction. Data from recent prospective studies suggest that patients with AHF with concomitant acute hypertension benefit from intravenous (IV) vasodilators. To better understand the use of vasodilators for such patients, we conducted a systematic review of (1) currently available intravenous vasodilators for ED patients with AHF, or (2) intravenous vasodilators that are not yet available, but have completed phase III clinical trials in AHF, and may be available for ED use in the future. We used multiterm search queries to retrieve research involving nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, enalaprilat, hydralazine, relaxin, and nesiritide. A total of 2001 unique citations were identified from 3 databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Of these, 1966 were excluded on the basis of established review criteria, leaving 35 published articles for inclusion. Our primary finding was that intravenous nitrovasodilators, when used in the treatment of AHF in ED and ED-like settings, do improve short-term symptoms and appear safe to administer. There are no data suggesting that they impact mortality. Other commonly used vasodilators such as hydralazine and enalaprilat have very little published data about their safety and efficacy. Of note, few studies enrolled patients early in their course of treatment. Thus, to assess the specific impact of vasodilator therapy on both short- and long-term outcomes, future research efforts should focus on patient recruitment in the ED setting.			2015				6277
SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMES IN STAGES 1-4 CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: A LITERATURE REVIEW		Bonner, Ann, Havas, Kathryn, Douglas, Clint, Thepha, Thiwawan, Bennett, Paul and Clark, Robyn				journal of renal care	journal of renal care	BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a complex health problem, which requires individuals to invest considerable time and energy in managing their health and adhering to multifaceted treatment regimens. OBJECTIVES: To review studies delivering self-management interventions to people with CKD (Stages 1-4) and assess whether these interventions improve patient outcomes. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Nine electronic databases (MedLine, CINAHL, EMBASE, ProQuest Health & Medical Complete, ProQuest Nursing & Allied Health, The Cochrane Library, The Joanna Briggs Institute EBP Database, Web of Science and PsycINFO) were searched using relevant terms for papers published between January 2003 and February 2013. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 2,051 papers, of which 34 were retrieved in full with only 5 studies involving 274 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. Three studies were randomised controlled trials, a variety of methods were used to measure outcomes, and four studies included a nurse on the self-management intervention team. There was little consistency in the delivery, intensity, duration and format of the self-management programmes. There is some evidence that knowledge- and health-related quality of life improved. Generally, small effects were observed for levels of adherence and progression of CKD according to physiologic measures. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of self-management programmes in CKD (Stages 1-4) cannot be conclusively ascertained, and further research is required. It is desirable that individuals with CKD are supported to effectively self-manage day-to-day aspects of their health.			2014				3755
Montelukast for prevention and treatment of asthma exacerbations in adults: Systematic review and meta-analysis		Zhang, H. P., Jia, C. E., Lv, Y., Gibson, P. G. and Wang, G.				allergy and asthma proceedings : the official journal of regional and state allergy societies	allergy and asthma proceedings : the official journal of regional and state allergy societies	It has proven efficacy in reducing asthma exacerbations, but the effect size of montelukast (a leukotriene receptor antagonist) for varied severity of asthma exacerbations is not systematically assessed. This study was designed to systematically explore the evidence for montelukast, as first-line or add-on therapy, in preventing and treating asthma exacerbations in adult patients with asthma. Randomized controlled trials were searched in PubMed, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Embase, and OVID up to March 2013, where montelukast prevented or treated asthma exacerbations in adults. Primary outcomes were the number of patients experiencing exacerbations in chronic asthma and hospitalizations in acute asthma. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), risk difference, and number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated and pooled. Adverse events were also assessed in chronic asthma. Twenty trials for chronic asthma and six for acute asthma were identified. In comparison with placebo, adults with chronic asthma receiving montelukast had significantly reduced number of exacerbations (OR = 0.60 and 95% CI, 0.49, 0.74; NNT = 17 and 95% CI, 12, 29). However, montelukast was inferior to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) (OR = 1.63; 95% CI, 1.29, 2.0) and ICS plus long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA; OR = 3.94; 95% CI, 1.64, 9.48) as the first-line therapies and LABA (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05, 1.42) as the add-on therapies in reducing asthma exacerbations. In acute asthma, montelukast could statistically improve peak expiratory flow percent predicted (p = 0.008) and reduce systemic corticosteroid intake (p = 0.005). Montelukast had low risk in hoarseness and insomnia. Our meta-analysis suggests that montelukast significantly reduces mild, moderate, and part of severe exacerbations in chronic mild to moderate asthma, but it has inferior efficacy to ICS or ICS plus LABA.			2014				3393
A safety evaluation of aripiprazole for treating schizophrenia during pregnancy and puerperium		Gentile, S.				expert opinion on drug safety	expert opinion on drug safety	Introduction: Aripiprazole (ARI) is a second-generation antipsychotic acting as a dopamine-serotonin system stabilizer and partial agonist at D2 receptors. The drug is indicated in several and severe psychiatric disorders which are particularly frequent in women during the childbearing age. Area covered: A systematic review of studies investigating the reproductive safety of ARI. Expert opinion: For first trimester use, reviewed data provide no clear evidence about the safety of the drug for the developing fetus. However, a decline of plasma levels (PLs) throughout the pregnancy compared with PLs before pregnancy was observed. This finding suggests the need to increase the dosage during pregnancy in order to maintain stable PLs. If used during late pregnancy, some signals exist suggesting that ARI may worse neonatal outcomes. Hence, clinicians should consider withdrawing the drug before the last month of pregnancy to reduce the risks of neonatal complications. However, such risks must be weighed against the risks of woman's symptom deterioration. In any case, parturition should happen in hospitals equipped with well-organized neonatal intensive care units. No information is available on the impact of antenatal exposure to ARI on the main neurodevelopmental milestones. Infant exposure to the drug through maternal milk may increase the risk of insufficient milk production and neonatal somnolence.			2014				3910
Intrasite Vancomycin Powder for the Prevention of Surgical Site Infection in Spine Surgery: A Systematic Literature Review		Kang, D. G., Holekamp, T. F., Wagner, S. C. and Lehman, R. A.				the spine journal : official journal of the north american spine society	the spine journal : official journal of the north american spine society	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Deep surgical site infections (SSIs) following spinal surgery are a significant burden to the patient, patient's family and the healthcare system. Due to increasing pressures to reduce SSIs and control costs, some spine surgeons have begun placing lyophilized vancomycin powder directly into the surgical wound at the conclusion of the procedure. However, the literature supporting this practice remains limited. PURPOSE: To review the current literature examining the use of prophylactic intrasite vancomycin powder to control SSIs in spinal surgery, and determine if any standard recommendations can be made. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Systematic review. METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE and PubMed were searched to identify English language articles. RESULTS: No current guidelines are available for the use of intrasite vancomycin powder in preventing surgical site infections, and no standard dosage for the drug exists. Based on the limited literature currently available, there appears to be a protective effect of intrasite vancomycin powder on the incidence of SSI without evidence of significant risk of side effects, but the evidence is limited. However, case reports do exist describing systemic side effects following intrasite vancomycin powder during spine surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The interpretation of the available evidence supporting the use of intrasite vancomycin powder in surgical wounds is limited, and its extrapolation should be performed with caution. Despite the lack of significant high-quality evidence available in the literature, many surgeons have adopted this practice; anecdotally it continues to provide protection from infection without apparent significant risk of side effects.			2015				7344
Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in older patients: a systematic review		Xie, C., Li, J., Wang, K., Li, Q. and Chen, D.				travel medicine and infectious disease	travel medicine and infectious disease	OBJECTIVE: Here, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotic interventions in prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (CDD) in older patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Web of Science were comprehensively searched from their dates of inception to May 2014. Only randomised controlled trials reporting data on probiotics including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus-alone or in combination-versus placebo or absence of treatment in older patients (age ?65 years) were included. Risk ratios (RRs) for AAD and CDD relative to placebo or absence of treatment were estimated. RESULTS: Six trials with a total of 3562 patients were included. Only one trial showed that Bacillus licheniformis was effective for preventing AAD in older patients. However, there was no preventive effect for AAD and CDD with Lactobacillus acidophilus (Florajen), Lactobacillus casei Shirota, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (boulardii) lyo, mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum (Cultech strains), and mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60, CUL21, Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 and B. lactis CUL34. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that probiotics may not reduce the risk of AAD and CDD in older patients. However, with current published data, it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions. To confirm these findings, sample sizes, multi-centre, double-blind studies that consider factors such as probiotic strains and types of antibiotics are required.			2015				9151
A Systematic Review of Adjuvant Interventions for Radioiodine in Patients with Thyroid Cancer		Xu, G., Wu, T., Ge, L. and Li, W.				oncology research and treatment	oncology research and treatment	AIMS: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of adjuvant interventions for radioiodine in patients with thyroid cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was undertaken on July 9, 2014. RevMan 5 software was used to synthesize data. RESULTS: 13 randomized controlled trials were included. The pooled risk ratio of 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96-1.02, p = 0.58) indicated no significant difference in successful thyroid remnant ablation between recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) and thyroid hormone withdrawal in 7 trials. The percentage of patients who had successful ablation was significantly higher in the oral-lithium group than in the control group (p = 0.017). A computerized decision aid improves informed decision-making in patients with early-stage papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) who are considering adjuvant radioiodine treatment (p < 0.001). Amifostine pretreatment did not prevent parenchymal damage to the major salivary gland function after radioiodine treatment (p = 0.2461). CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review suggests that rhTSH, lithium, and computerized decision aids maybe act as beneficial adjuvant interventions for radioiodine in patients with thyroid cancer; however, amifostine does not exhibit helpful effects in thyroid cancer patients treated with radioiodine.			2015				6092
Probiotics for the Primary and Secondary Prevention of C. difficile Infections: A Meta-analysis and Systematic Review		McFarland, L. V.				antibiotics (basel, switzerland)	antibiotics (basel, switzerland)	Clostridium difficile infections are a global clinical concern and are one of the leading causes of nosocomial outbreaks. Preventing these infections has benefited from multidisciplinary infection control strategies and new antibiotics, but the problem persists. Probiotics are effective in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea and may also be a beneficial strategy for C. difficile infections, but randomized controlled trials are scarce. This meta-analysis pools 21 randomized, controlled trials for primary prevention of C. difficile infections (CDI) and four trials for secondary prevention of C. difficile recurrences and assesses the efficacy of specific probiotic strains. Four probiotics significantly improved primary CDI prevention: (Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus casei DN114001, a mixture of L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum, and a mixture of L. acidophilus, L. casei and L. rhamnosus). None of the tested probiotics significantly improved secondary prevention of CDI. More confirmatory randomized trials are needed to establish if probiotics are useful for preventing C. difficile infections. v.			2015				8907
Comparative Efficacy of Novel DMARDs as Monotherapy and in Combination with Methotrexate in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients with Inadequate Response to Conventional DMARDs: A Network Meta-Analysis		Buckley, F., Finckh, A., Huizinga, T. W., Dejonckheere, F. and Jansen, J. P.				journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy	journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy	BACKGROUND: Given the availability of a number of alternative biologic treatment options and other novel disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clinicians are faced with an increasingly challenging choice regarding optimal treatment. Biologics are usually combined with traditional DMARDs, primarily methotrexate (MTX), but some biologics and tofacitinib (together referred to in this article as novel DMARDs) have been shown to be efficacious as monotherapy as well. In real-world practice, approximately one-third of RA patients receiving biologics are on monotherapy, primarily because of intolerance of, or noncompliance with, MTX. Limited data, however, are available analyzing the effectiveness of monotherapy compared with combination therapy across novel DMARDs. OBJECTIVE: To compare American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses to approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) at 24 weeks in RA patients who have shown inadequate response to conventional DMARDs (DMARD-IR).  METHODS: Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified randomized controlled trials that assessed approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with MTX in DMARD-IR RA patients. Twenty-eight RCTs were identified that evaluated abatacept, anakinra, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, tocilizumab, or tofacitinib. ACR responses at 24 weeks were extracted and combined by means of Bayesian network meta-analyses.  RESULTS: With the exception of anakinra plus MTX, which was less efficacious, most novel DMARDs, when used in combination with MTX, demonstrated comparable ACR responses. When novel DMARDs were used as monotherapies, greater ACR20/50/70 responses were observed with tocilizumab than with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (aTNF) or tofacitinib. Furthermore, ACR20/50/70 responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab monotherapy (odds ratio [OR] for the indirect comparison?=?1.08, 95% credible interval [CrI]?=?0.40-2.84; OR?=?1.24, CrI?=?0.44-3.61; OR?=?0.95, CrI?=?0.33-2.72, respectively), whereas greater responses were observed with aTNF plus MTX than with aTNF monotherapy (OR?=?2.41, CrI?=?0.51-11.61; OR?=?2.85, CrI?=?0.51-17.67; OR?=?1.28, CrI?=?0.21-8.42, respectively). Relative efficacy estimates for the indirect comparison of tofacitinib plus MTX with tofacitinib monotherapy were very uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that in combination with MTX most of the available novel DMARDs have similar levels of efficacy in DMARD-IR patients. As monotherapy, however, tocilizumab displayed higher ACR responses than aTNF or tofacitinib. ACR responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab as monotherapy, whereas aTNF in combination with MTX demonstrated greater ACR responses than aTNF as monotherapy.			2015				11121
Impact of Male Partner Antenatal Accompaniment on Perinatal Health Outcomes in Developing Countries: A Systematic Literature Review		Aguiar, C. and Jennings, L.				maternal and child health journal	maternal and child health journal	Encouraging male partners to accompany women to antenatal care (ANC) is an important first step in engaging men on maternal and newborn health. However, little is known regarding the impact of male partner antenatal accompaniment beyond HIV-related perinatal outcomes. A systematic review was conducted to synthesize the evidence on the influence of male accompaniment on non-HIV outcomes during pregnancy and into the postpartum period. Eligible studies were published in English from 2003 to 2013 and evaluated the effect of male antenatal accompaniment on perinatal health in a developing country. Four electronic databases and selected reference lists were searched. Out of 84 potential citations retrieved, seven publications were retained for the assessment of male antenatal accompaniment's influence using iterative thematic analysis. During pregnancy, male antenatal accompaniment positively impacted women's knowledge of danger signs, but did not affect birth preparedness, ANC utilization, or miscarriages. During labor and delivery, men's ANC presence was associated with increases in institutional delivery and skilled birth attendance, but with no effect for birth-related outcomes. During the early postnatal period, male antenatal accompaniment was associated with higher uptake of postnatal services, but with mixed effects on breastfeeding and newborn survival. Couples' increased communication on pregnancy care and men's subsequent motivation to ensure safe delivery may explain these observed benefits. Inadequate communication, late accompaniment, or partner type may explain the lack of influence on some outcomes. More efforts are needed to expand the implementation and evaluation of male involvement strategies to improve perinatal health.			2015				7555
Systemic therapy options for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors beyond first-line imatinib: a systematic review		Abdel-Rahman, O. and Fouad, M.				future oncology (london, england)	future oncology (london, england)	ABSTRACT? This systematic review aims at assessment of the available evidence for systemic therapy options for patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors beyond first-line imatinib. Eligible trials were identified using databases search. In total, 26 studies were eligible and included in the final analysis. Among second-line studies, median progression-free survival ranged from 1.9 to 10 months while median overall survival ranged from 15 to 62 months. Among third-line agents, median progression-free survival ranged from 1.8 to 4.6 months while median overall survival ranged from 8.2 to 19 months. The available data for the second-line suggest that sunitinib is the best option while in the third line, regorafenib is the best option.			2015				6055
Lifestyle interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention in women with prior gestational diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of behavioural, anthropometric and metabolic outcomes		Gilinsky, A. S., Kirk, A. F., Hughes, A. R. and Lindsay, R. S.				preventive medicine reports	preventive medicine reports	PURPOSE: To systematically review lifestyle interventions for women with prior Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) to report study characteristics, intervention design and study quality and explore changes in 1) diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviour; 2) anthropometric outcomes and; 3) glycaemic control and diabetes risk. METHODS: Databases (Web of Science, CCRCT, EMBASE and Science DIRECT) were searched (1980 to April 2014) using keywords for controlled or pre-post design trials of lifestyle intervention targeting women with previous GDM reporting at least one behavioural, anthropometric or diabetes outcome. Selected studies were narratively synthesized with anthropometric and glycaemic outcomes synthesized using meta-analysis. RESULTS: Three of 13 included studies were rated as low bias risk. Recruitment rates were poor but study retention good. Six of 11 studies reporting on physical activity reported favourable intervention effects. All six studies reporting on diet reported favourable intervention effects. In meta-analysis, significant weight-loss was attributable to one Chinese population study (WMD = - 1.06 kg (95% CI = - 1.68, - 0.44)). Lifestyle interventions did not change fasting blood glucose (WMD = - 0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI = - 0.21, 0.11) or type 2 diabetes risk. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of methodologically robust trials gives limited evidence for the success of lifestyle interventions in women with prior GDM. Recruitment into trials is challenging.			2015				9984
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of adjunctive ketamine in electroconvulsive therapy: Efficacy and tolerability		McGirr, A., Berlim, M. T., Bond, D. J., Neufeld, N. H., Chan, P. Y., Yatham, L. N. and Lam, R. W.				journal of psychiatric research	journal of psychiatric research	BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains one of the most effective tools in the psychiatric treatment armamentarium, particularly for refractory depression. Yet, there remains a subset of patients who do not respond to ECT or for whom clinically adequate seizures cannot be elicited, for whom ketamine has emerged as a putative augmentation agent. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and MEDLINE from 1962 to April 2014 to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating ketamine in ECT (PROSPERO #CRD42014009035). Clinical remission, response, and change in depressive symptom scores were extracted by two independent raters. Adverse events were recorded. Drop-outs were assessed as a proxy for acceptability. Meta-analyses employed a random effects model. RESULTS: Data were synthesized from 5 RCTs, representing a total of 182 patients with major depressive episodes (n = 165 Major Depressive Disorder, n = 17 Bipolar Disorder). ECT with ketamine augmentation was not associated with higher rates of clinical remission (Risk Difference (RD) = 0.00; 95%CI = -0.08 to 0.10), response (RD = -0.01; 95%CI = -0.11 to 0.08), or improvements in depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.38; 95%CI = -0.41 to 1.17). Ketamine augmentation was associated with higher rates of confusion/disorientation/prolonged delirium (OR = 6.59, 95%CI: 1.28-33.82, NNH = 3), but not agitation, hypertension or affective switches. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of ketamine augmentation in the ECT setting suggests a lack of clinical efficacy, and an increased likelihood of confusion. Individuals for whom adequate seizures or therapeutic response cannot be obtained have not been studied using randomized controlled designs. Additional research is required to address the role of ketamine in this population.			2015				9623
The Efficacy of Written Information Intervention in Reduction of Hospital Re-admission Cost in Patients With Heart Failure; A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Zarea Gavgani, V., Kazemi Majd, F., Nosratnejad, S., Golmohammadi, A. and Sadeghi-Bazargani, H.				journal of cardiovascular and thoracic research	journal of cardiovascular and thoracic research	OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of written information versus non written information intervention in reducing hospital readmission cost, if prescribed or presented to the patients with HF. METHODS: The study was a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Medline (Ovid) and Cochrane library during the past 20 years from 1993 to 2013. We also conducted a manual search through Google Scholar and a direct search in the group of related journals in Black Well and Science Direct trough their websites. Two reviewers appraised the identified studies, and meta-analysis was done to estimate the mean saving cost of patient readmission. All the included studies must have been done by randomization to be eligible for study. RESULT: We assessed the full-texts 3 out of 65 studies with 754 patients and average age of 74.33. The mean of estimated saving readmission cost in intervention group versus control group was US $2751 (95% CI: 2708 - 2794) and the mean of total saving cost in intervention group versus control group was US $2047 (base year 2010) with (95% CI: 2004 - 2089). No publication bias was found by testing the heterogeneity of studies. CONCLUSION: One of the effective factors in minimizing the healthcare cost and preventing from hospital re-admission is providing the patients with information prescription in a written format. It is suggested that hospital management, Medicare organizations, policy makers and individual physicians consider the prescription of appropriate medical information as the indispensable part of patient's care process.			2015				8031
Systematic review of laparoscopic comprehensive staging surgery in early stage ovarian cancer: A meta-analysis		Lu, Y., Yao, D. S. and Xu, J. H.				taiwanese journal of obstetrics & gynecology	taiwanese journal of obstetrics & gynecology	OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic comprehensive staging surgery in early stage ovarian cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic literature searches were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and literature on laparoscopy versus laparotomy for comprehensive staging surgery was retrieved. The literature was selected according to certain inclusion criteria. Data were extracted from these studies and the quality of the included studies was assessed. The meta-analysis was conducted using the Review Manager 5.2 software. RESULTS: A total of 11 nonrandomized controlled trials involving 591 cases were included. The pooled data indicated less intraoperative blood loss, lower postoperative complication rates, shorter postoperative hospital stays, and lower postoperative recurrence rates in the laparoscopy group. There were no significant differences in operative time, harvested lymph node number, intraoperative complications, or mortality. CONCLUSION: For comprehensive staging surgery, laparoscopy was equivalent to or even better than conventional laparotomy for early ovarian cancer. More robust evidence should be explored for precise verification.			2015				8873
Association of Drug Effects on Serum Parathyroid Hormone, Phosphorus, and Calcium Levels With Mortality in CKD: A Meta-analysis		Palmer, S. C., Teixeira-Pinto, A., Saglimbene, V., Craig, J. C., Macaskill, P., Tonelli, M., de Berardis, G., Ruospo, M. and Strippoli, G. F.				american journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the national kidney foundation	american journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the national kidney foundation	BACKGROUND: Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), phosphorus, and calcium levels are surrogate outcomes that are central to the evaluation of drug treatments in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review evaluates the evidence for the correlation between drug effects on biochemical (PTH, phosphorus, and calcium) and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality end points in adults with CKD. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING & POPULATION: Adults with CKD. SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: Randomized trials reporting drug effects on biochemical and mortality end points. INTERVENTION: Drug interventions with effects on serum PTH, phosphorus, and calcium levels, including vitamin D compounds, phosphate binders, cinacalcet, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin. OUTCOMES: Correlation between drug effects on biochemical and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: 28 studies (6,999 participants) reported both biochemical and mortality outcomes and were eligible for analysis. Associations between drug effects on surrogate biochemical end points and corresponding effects on mortality were weak and imprecise. All correlation coefficients were less than 0.70, and 95% credible intervals were generally wide and overlapped with zero, consistent with the possibility of no association. The exception was an inverse correlation between drug effects on serum PTH levels and all-cause mortality, which was nominally significant (-0.64; 95% credible interval, -0.85 to -0.15), but the strength of this association was very imprecise. Risk of bias within available trials was generally high, further reducing confidence in the summary correlations. Findings were robust to adjustment for age, baseline serum PTH level, allocation concealment, CKD stage, and drug class. LIMITATIONS: Low power in analyses and combining evidence from many different drug comparisons with incomplete data across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Drug effects on serum PTH, phosphorus, and calcium levels are weakly and imprecisely correlated with all-cause and cardiovascular death in the setting of CKD. Risks of mortality (patient-level outcome) cannot be inferred from treatment-induced changes in biochemical outcomes in people with CKD. Similarly, existing data do not exclude a mortality benefit with treatment. Trials need to address patient-centered outcomes to evaluate drug effectiveness in this setting.			2015				10369
Evidence for treating rheumatoid arthritis to target: results of a systematic literature search update		Stoffer, M. A., Schoels, M. M., Smolen, J. S., Aletaha, D., Breedveld, F. C., Burmester, G., Bykerk, V., Dougados, M., Emery, P., Haraoui, B., Gomez-Reino, J., Kvien, T. K., Nash, P., Navarro-Compán, V., Scholte-Voshaar, M., van Vollenhoven, R., van der Heijde, D. and Stamm, T. A.				annals of the rheumatic diseases	annals of the rheumatic diseases	OBJECTIVE: A systematic literature review (SLR; 2009-2014) to compare a target-oriented approach with routine management in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to allow an update of the treat-to-target recommendations. METHODS: Two SLRs focused on clinical trials employing a treatment approach targeting a specific clinical outcome were performed. In addition to testing clinical, functional and/or structural changes as endpoints, comorbidities, cardiovascular risk, work productivity and education as well as patient self-assessment were investigated. The searches covered MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases and Clinicaltrial.gov for the period between 2009 and 2012 and separately for the period of 2012 to May of 2014. RESULTS: Of 8442 citations retrieved in the two SLRs, 176 articles underwent full-text review. According to predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, six articles were included of which five showed superiority of a targeted treatment approach aiming at least at low-disease activity versus routine care; in addition, publications providing supportive evidence were also incorporated that aside from expanding the evidence provided by the above six publications allowed concluding that a target-oriented approach leads to less comorbidities and cardiovascular risk and better work productivity than conventional care. CONCLUSIONS: The current study expands the evidence that targeting low-disease activity or remission in the management of RA conveys better outcomes than routine care.			2016				10441
Robotic radical hysterectomy in early stage cervical cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Shazly, S. A., Murad, M. H., Dowdy, S. C., Gostout, B. S. and Famuyide, A. O.				gynecologic oncology	gynecologic oncology	OBJECTIVE: To compare intraoperative and short-term postoperative outcomes of robotic radical hysterectomy (RRH) to laparoscopic and open approaches in the treatment of early stage cervical cancer. METHODS: A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE (using Ovid interface) and SCOPUS databases was conducted from database inception through February 15, 2014. We included studies comparing surgical approaches to radical hysterectomy (robotic vs. laparoscopic or abdominal, or both) in women with stages IA1-IIA cervical cancer. Intraoperative outcomes included estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time, number of pelvic lymph nodes harvested and intraoperative complications. Postoperative outcomes were hospital stay and surgical morbidity. The random effects model was used to pool weighted mean differences (WMDs) and odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: Twenty six nonrandomized studies were included (10 RRH vs abdominal radical hysterectomy [ARH], 9 RRH vs laparoscopic radical hysterectomy [LRH] and 7 compared all 3 approaches) enrolling 4013 women (1013 RRH, 710 LRH and 2290 ARH). RRH was associated with less EBL (WMD=384.3, 95% CI=233.7, 534.8) and shorter hospital stay (WMD=3.55, 95% CI=2.10, 5.00) than ARH. RRH was also associated with lower odds of febrile morbidity (OR=0.43, 95% CI=0.20-0.89), blood transfusion (OR=0.12, 95% CI 0.06, 0.25) and wound-related complications (OR=0.31, 95% CI=0.13, 0.73) vs. ARH. RRH was comparable to LRH in all intra- and postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that RRH may be superior to ARH with lower EBL, shorter hospital stay, less febrile morbidity and wound-related complications. RRH and LRH appear equivalent in intraoperative and short-term postoperative outcomes and thus the choice of approach can be tailored to the choice of patient and surgeon.			2015				8883
Benefit of intraoperative navigation on glenoid component positioning during total shoulder arthroplasty		Sadoghi, P., Vavken, J., Leithner, A. and Vavken, P.				archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery	archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery	"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to review and synthesize the current best evidence for the use of intraoperative navigation in the implantation of glenoid components in total shoulder prostheses. METHODS: We conducted a systematic, online search using PubMed, EMBASE, CCTR, and CINAHL using ""Arthroplasty, Replacement""(Mesh) AND (shoulder) AND (navi* OR computer). Data on study design and quality as well as accuracy of positioning and complications were extracted independently and in duplicate. After assessment of study heterogeneity, DerSimonian-Laird random effect models were used to pool data from the individual studies. RESULTS: The systematic search revealed 359 manuscripts in total. After exclusion of duplicates and irrelevant publications, 6 groups of 247 shoulders from 5 studies were included. The pooled weighted mean difference for deviation from neutral version was -6.4° (95 %CI -7.9 to -5.3) in favor of navigation, which is consistent with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01). In the navigation group, 2 superior glenoid screws were reported as perforating compared to 5 screws (1 inferior, 4 superior) in the control group. There was no difference in tilt at a WMD of 2.7 (95 %CI -1.4 to 6.8, p = 0.192). CONCLUSIONS: Navigation allows for significantly more accurate glenoid version, but the clinical meaningfulness of the absolute improvement over standard techniques is questionable. However, navigation is a valuable teaching tool that might prove very beneficial not for the patient at hand, but for those treated by the operating surgeon in the future.

Gum chewing and gastrointestinal function following caesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Hochner, H., Tenfelde, S. M., Abu Ahmad, W. and Liebergall-Wischnitzer, M.				journal of clinical nursing	journal of clinical nursing	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to summarise current knowledge regarding gum chewing intervention for activation of the gastrointestinal (GI) system following caesarean delivery. BACKGROUND: GI symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and defecatory difficulties are bothersome for women following a caesarean delivery. There is category A recommendation to not withhold oral intake postoperatively. However, current practice guidelines vary widely on time to initiate oral feeding post caesarean delivery, and additional research is needed. Gum chewing has been shown to stimulate the GI system in other postoperative patient populations. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: An electronic review was undertaken using the following resources: PubMed (Medline), CINAHL, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Key words used in various combinations included cesarean section; cesarean delivery; postoperative chewing gum; bowel movement; bowel function and complications. RESULTS: A total of 171 articles were found of which 166 were excluded: 157 were duplicates and the remainder did not meet the inclusion criteria. Five randomised control trials were included in the meta-analysis, focusing on gum chewing as an intervention as compared with a nongum chewing intervention, with a total of 846 participants. Compared with the nongum chewing group, gum chewing showed a beneficial impact on the major outcomes of digestive system activation, including bowel sound, gas passage and defecation. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports the effectiveness of gum chewing post caesarean delivery as a noninvasive/nonpharmacological intervention for reactivation of bowel movement. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Gum chewing in the immediate postoperative period following caesarean delivery may provide a socially acceptable, low-cost and safe intervention to reduce postcaesarean delivery GI complications and restore GI function.			2015				5951
ACL Graft and Contralateral ACL Tear Risk within Ten Years Following Reconstruction: A Systematic Review		Magnussen, R. A., Meschbach, N. T., Kaeding, C. C., Wright, R. W. and Spindler, K. P.				jbjs reviews	jbjs reviews	BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft tear and contralateral ACL injury have devastating effects on patient outcomes following ACL reconstruction. Long-term results after ACL reconstruction are being reported with greater frequency, allowing a detailed analysis of the long-term risk of failure. METHODS: A systematic review of prospective studies that recorded the risk of ACL graft rupture and contralateral ACL injury following primary ACL reconstruction was performed. All studies included intra-articular ACL reconstruction with modern techniques and patellar tendon or hamstring autograft with a minimum follow-up of ten years. RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The overall ACL graft rupture risk was 7.9% (211 ruptures in 2682 reconstructions) and ranged from 3.2% to 11.1% in the individual studies. The overall risk of ACL injury in the contralateral limb was 12.5% (335 injuries in 2682 reconstructions) and ranged from 0.6% to 22.7% in the individual studies. Among the seven homogeneous studies that were pooled, the overall risk of a contralateral ACL tear was 1.63 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30 to 2.04) times that of a graft tear during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: At a minimum follow-up time of ten years, the risk of contralateral ACL tear significantly exceeds the risk of ACL graft rupture. Further work is necessary to understand and potentially reduce this risk of graft and contralateral ACL tears. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level II.

Effects of probiotics on child growth: a systematic review		Onubi, O. J., Poobalan, A. S., Dineen, B., Marais, D. and McNeill, G.				journal of health, population, and nutrition	journal of health, population, and nutrition	BACKGROUND: Child undernutrition has short and long term consequence for both individuals and society. Previous studies show probiotics may promote child growth and have an impact on under-nutrition. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was carried out on three electronic databases to assess evidence. The outcome measured was change in weight or height. A narrative analysis was conducted due to heterogeneity of included studies. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the review of which ten were randomised controlled trials. A total of 2757 children were included, with 1598 from developing countries. The studies varied in type and quantity of probiotics given, duration of interventions, characteristics of participants, setting and units of outcome measures. Overall, five studies found a positive effect of probiotics on child growth. All five were conducted in developing countries with four studies conducted in mostly under-nourished children and one in well-nourished children. No significant effect on growth was found in the seven studies that were conducted in developed countries. CONCLUSION: The limited evidence suggests that probiotics have the potential to improve child growth in developing countries and in under-nourished children. More research is needed to explore this further.			2015				5541
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Multi-component Interventions Through Schools to Increase Physical Activity		Russ, L. B., Webster, C. A., Beets, M. W. and Phillips, D. S.				journal of physical activity & health	journal of physical activity & health	"BACKGROUND: A ""whole-of-school"" approach is nationally endorsed to increase youth physical activity (PA). Aligned with this approach, comprehensive school physical activity programs (CSPAP) are recommended. Distinct components of a CSPAP include quality physical education [QPE], PA during the school day [PADSD], PA before/after school [PABAS], staff wellness [SW], and family/community engagement [FCE]. The effectiveness of interventions incorporating multiple CSPAP components is unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted examining the effectiveness of multi-component interventions on youth total daily PA. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for published studies that (1) occurred in the US; (2) targeted K-12 (5-18 years old); (3) were interventions; (4) reflected ?2 CSPAP components, with at least one targeting school-based PA during school hours; and (5) reported outcomes as daily PA improvements. Standardized mean effects (Hedge's g) from pooled random effects inverse-variance models were estimated. RESULTS: Across 14 studies, 12 included QPE, 5 PADSD, 1 PABAS, 2 SW, and 14 FCE. No studies included all 5 CSPAP components. Overall, intervention impact was small (0.11, 95CI 0.03 to 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: As designed, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of multi-component interventions to increase youth total daily PA. Increased alignment with CSPAP recommendations may improve intervention effectiveness."			2015				6562
The freestyle valve as a right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit. A systematic review and meta-analysis		Dunne, B., Suthers, E., Xiao, P., Xiao, J., Litton, E. and Andrews, D.				heart, lung and vessels	heart, lung and vessels	INTRODUCTION: Reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract is the most commonly performed valve repair/replacement procedure in congenital cardiac surgery. There is an ongoing shortage of homografts, and existing bioprosthetic options suffer from substantial rates of structural valve deterioration over time. The Medtronic Freestyle valve is used extensively in the aortic position, but little data is available on its performance in the pulmonary position. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of primary studies reporting echocardiographic and clinical outcomes, including reintervention and functional status, associated with the Freestyle valve in the pulmonary position for both Ross and congenital surgery. RESULTS: 13 observational studies including 334 patients with a mean follow-up of 34 months (range 10-98 months) fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Structural valve deterioration occurred in 4.8% (95% confidence interval 0.8-10.6%) of patients. Reintervention was required in 1.1% (95% confidence interval 0.0-3.3%). Freedom from symptoms of heart failure occurred in 97.7% (94.6-99.7%). The results did not change substantially when analysed according to Ross or congenital surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The Freestyle valve performs well at short-term follow-up and provides a viable alternative when homografts are unavailable. Further long-term studies are required to better assess its role in right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction.			2015				6211
Drilling: medical indications and surgical technique		Hueb, C. K., Dias Júnior, J. A., Abrão, M. S. and Filho, E. K.				revista da associac?a?o me?dica brasileira (1992)	revista da associac?a?o me?dica brasileira (1992)	"INTRODUCTION: anovulation is a major cause of female infertility, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the leading cause of anovulation. While undergoing drug-induced ovulation, women with PCOS usually have a satisfactory response recruiting follicles, but some are unable to recruit follicles or often produce an excessive number of follicles, which can result in ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome and/or multiple pregnancy. Surgical laparoscopy with ovarian ""drilling"" may prevent or reduce the need for drug-induced ovulation. OBJECTIVE: to identify the current indications of laparoscopic ovarian drilling and the best surgical technique. METHOD: a review of the medical literature based on systematic search in the Medline, Lilacs and Cochrane databases, using as keywords laparoscopy, polycystic ovary syndrome, and drilling. RESULTS: we found 105 articles in the literature, 27 of these highly relevant, describing findings on ovarian drilling. CONCLUSION: laparoscopic drilling is indicated for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome with ovulatory resistance to the use of clomiphene citrate, body mass index less than 30 kg/m2 and preoperative luteinizing hormone above 10 IU/L. The preferred surgical technique should be the realization of 5 to 10 perforations on the surface of each ovary bilaterally using monopolar energy."			2015				10665
Cannabidiol as an Intervention for Addictive Behaviors: A Systematic Review of the Evidence		Prud'homme, M., Cata, R. and Jutras-Aswad, D.				substance abuse : research and treatment	substance abuse : research and treatment	Drug addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder characterized by the compulsive desire to use drugs and a loss of control over consumption. Cannabidiol (CBD), the second most abundant component of cannabis, is thought to modulate various neuronal circuits involved in drug addiction. The goal of this systematic review is to summarize the available preclinical and clinical data on the impact of CBD on addictive behaviors. MEDLINE and PubMed were searched for English and French language articles published before 2015. In all, 14 studies were found, 9 of which were conducted on animals and the remaining 5 on humans. A limited number of preclinical studies suggest that CBD may have therapeutic properties on opioid, cocaine, and psychostimulant addiction, and some preliminary data suggest that it may be beneficial in cannabis and tobacco addiction in humans. Further studies are clearly necessary to fully evaluate the potential of CBD as an intervention for addictive disorders.			2015				6053

A systematic review of pre-operative anaemia and blood transfusion in patients with fractured hips		Potter, L. J., Doleman, B. and Moppett, I. K.				anaesthesia	anaesthesia	We systematically reviewed the observational associations of anaemia with outcomes and the effects of interventions to increase haemoglobin concentrations following hip fracture in older people. Anaemia on hospital admission was associated with increased mortality, relative risk 1.64 (95% CI 1.47-1.82), p < 0.0001. After adjustment for co-morbidities, the association of anaemia with increased mortality remained in four of eight observational studies. There was no association of postoperative transfusion with mortality after adjusting for covariates. Transfusion at 80 g.l(-1) vs 100 g.l(-1) increased acute myocardial infarction, relative risk 1.67 (95% CI 1.01-2.77), p = 0.05. Transfusion threshold was not associated with differences in other outcomes. There were insufficient high-quality studies to inform pre-operative blood transfusion or the use of peri-operative iron or erythropoietin. Studies for most interventions recruited too few participants to determine effects on infections, mortality or function.			2015				8982
Globalization of Continuing Professional Development by Journal Clubs via Microblogging: A Systematic Review		Roberts, M. J., Perera, M., Lawrentschuk, N., Romanic, D., Papa, N. and Bolton, D.				journal of medical internet research	journal of medical internet research	"BACKGROUND: Journal clubs are an essential tool in promoting clinical evidence-based medical education to all medical and allied health professionals. Twitter represents a public, microblogging forum that can facilitate traditional journal club requirements, while also reaching a global audience, and participation for discussion with study authors and colleagues. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the current state of social media-facilitated journal clubs, specifically Twitter, as an example of continuing professional development. METHODS: A systematic review of literature databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, ERIC via ProQuest) was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic search of Twitter, the followers of identified journal clubs, and Symplur was also performed. Demographic and monthly tweet data were extracted from Twitter and Symplur. All manuscripts related to Twitter-based journal clubs were included. Statistical analyses were performed in MS Excel and STATA. RESULTS: From a total of 469 citations, 11 manuscripts were included and referred to five Twitter-based journal clubs (#ALiEMJC, #BlueJC, #ebnjc, #urojc, #meded). A Twitter-based journal club search yielded 34 potential hashtags/accounts, of which 24 were included in the final analysis. The median duration of activity was 11.75 (interquartile range [IQR] 19.9, SD 10.9) months, with 7 now inactive. The median number of followers and participants was 374 (IQR 574) and 157 (IQR 272), respectively. An overall increasing establishment of active Twitter-based journal clubs was observed, resulting in an exponential increase in total cumulative tweets (R(2)=.98), and tweets per month (R(2)=.72). Cumulative tweets for specific journal clubs increased linearly, with @ADC_JC, @EBNursingBMJ, @igsjc, @iurojc, and @NephJC, and showing greatest rate of change, as well as total impressions per month since establishment. An average of two tweets per month was estimated for the majority of participants, while the ""Top 10"" tweeters for @iurojc showed a significantly lower contribution to overall tweets for each month (P<.005). A linearly increasing impression:tweet ratio was observed for the top five journal clubs. CONCLUSIONS: Twitter-based journal clubs are free, time-efficient, and publicly accessible means to facilitate international discussions regarding clinically important evidence-based research."			2015				6370
Comparative Effectiveness of Pharmacologic Interventions for Knee Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis		Bannuru, R. R., Schmid, C. H., Kent, D. M., Vaysbrot, E. E., Wong, J. B. and McAlindon, T. E.				annals of internal medicine	annals of internal medicine	BACKGROUND: The relative efficacy of available treatments of knee osteoarthritis (OA) must be determined for rational treatment algorithms to be formulated. PURPOSE: To examine the efficacy of treatments of primary knee OA using a network meta-analysis design, which estimates relative effects of all treatments against each other. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception through 15 August 2014, and unpublished data. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials of adults with knee OA comparing 2 or more of the following: acetaminophen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib, intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids, IA hyaluronic acid, oral placebo, and IA placebo. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently abstracted study data and assessed study quality. Standardized mean differences were calculated for pain, function, and stiffness at 3-month follow-up. DATA SYNTHESIS: Network meta-analysis was performed using a Bayesian random-effects model; 137 studies comprising 33 243 participants were identified. For pain, all interventions significantly outperformed oral placebo, with effect sizes from 0.63 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.39 to 0.88) for the most efficacious treatment (hyaluronic acid) to 0.18 (CrI, 0.04 to 0.33) for the least efficacious treatment (acetaminophen). For function, all interventions except IA corticosteroids were significantly superior to oral placebo. For stiffness, most of the treatments did not significantly differ from one another. LIMITATION: Lack of long-term data, inadequate reporting of safety data, possible publication bias, and few head-to-head comparisons. CONCLUSION: This method allowed comparison of common treatments of knee OA according to their relative efficacy. Intra-articular treatments were superior to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, possibly because of the integrated IA placebo effect. Small but robust differences were observed between active treatments. All treatments except acetaminophen showed clinically significant improvement from baseline pain. This information, along with the safety profiles and relative costs of included treatments, will be helpful for individualized patient care decisions.

Efficacy and safety of aripiprazole augmentation of clozapine in schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials		Srisurapanont, M., Suttajit, S., Maneeton, N. and Maneeton, B.				journal of psychiatric research	journal of psychiatric research	Limited options are available for clozapine-resistant schizophrenia and intolerable side effects of clozapine. We conducted a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole augmentation of clozapine for schizophrenia. Electronic databases searched included PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science. This review synthesized the data of four short-term (8-24 weeks), placebo-controlled trials (N = 347). The overall relative risk (RR, 95% confidence interval) of discontinuation rates was not significantly different between groups (RR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.78 to 2.56). The pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs, 95% CIs) (Z-test; number of study; I(2)-index) suggested trends of aripiprazole augmentation benefits on overall psychotic [-0.40 (-0.87 to 0.07) (n = 3; Z = 1.68, p = 0.09; I(2) = 68%)], positive [-1.05 (-2.39 to 0.29) (n = 3; Z = 1.54, p = 0.12; I(2) = 94%)], and negative [-0.36 (-0.77 to 0.05) (n = 3; Z = 1.74, p = 0.08; I(2) = 54%)] symptoms. Despite of no benefit on three cardiometabolic indices (i.e., fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein), aripiprazole augmentation was superior for weight change with a mean difference (95% CI) of -1.36 kg (-2.35 to -0.36) (n = 3; Z = 2.67, p = 0.008; I(2) = 39%) and LDL-cholesterol with a mean difference of -11.06 mg/dL (-18.25 to -3.87) (n = 3; Z = 3.02, p = 0.003; I(2) = 31%). Aripiprazole augmentation was not correlated with headache and insomnia but significantly associated with agitation/akathesia (RR = 7.59, 95% CI = 1.43 to 40.18) (n = 3; Z = 2.38, p = 0.02; I(2) = 0%) and anxiety (RR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.02 to 7.15) (n = 1; Z = 2.00, p = 0.05). The limited short-term data suggested that aripiprazole augmentation of clozapine can minimize the cardiometabolic risk, causes agitation/akathesia, and may be effective in attenuating psychotic symptoms.			2015				7681
Intratympanic corticosteroids injections: a systematic review of literature		Lavigne, P., Lavigne, F. and Saliba, I.				european archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the european federation of oto-rhino-laryngological societies (eufos) : affiliated with the german society for oto-rhino-laryngology - head and neck surgery	european archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the european federation of oto-rhino-laryngological societies (eufos) : affiliated with the german society for oto-rhino-laryngology - head and neck surgery	The objective of the study was to determine the evidence of intratympanic steroids injections (ITSI) for efficacy in the management of the following inner ear diseases: Ménière's disease, tinnitus, noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL). The data sources were literature review from 1946 to December 2014, PubMed and Medline. A systematic review of the existing literature was performed. Databases were searched for all human prospective randomized clinical trials using ITSI in at least one treatment group. The authors identified 29 prospective randomized clinical trials investigating the benefits of an intratympanic delivery of steroids. Six articles on Ménière's disease were identified, of which one favored ITSI over placebo in vertigo control. Of the five randomized clinical trials on tinnitus therapy, one study found better tinnitus control with ITSI. The only available trial on NIHL showed significant hearing recovery with combination therapy (ITSI and oral steroids therapy). Seventeen studies were identified on ISSNHL, of which 10 investigated ITSI as a first-line therapy and 7 as a salvage therapy. Studies analysis found benefits in hearing recovery in both settings. Due to heterogeneity in treatment protocols and follow-up, a meta-analysis was not performed. Given the low adverse effects rates of ITSI therapy and good patient tolerability, local delivery should be considered as an interesting adjunct to the therapy of the ISSNHL and NIHL. Only one article over six where ITSI therapy offers potential benefits to patients with Ménière's disease in the control of tinnitus and vertigo was found. ITSI does not seem to be effective in the treatment of tinnitus.			2016				5579
Telestroke, tele-oncology and teledialysis: a systematic review to analyse the outcomes of active therapies delivered with telemedicine support		Jhaveri, D., Larkins, S. and Sabesan, S.				journal of telemedicine and telecare	journal of telemedicine and telecare	We conducted a systematic review of studies involving telemedicine supervision of active treatment for rural patients in the fields of stroke, medical oncology and nephrology. Searches were performed on the MEDLINE, CINAHL and INFORMIT databases. A total of 521 articles were found, and an additional 42 articles were identified by searching the reference lists. After removing duplicates, screening the abstracts and assessing the full text of the articles, 14 articles remained. Nine concerned telestroke, two concerned tele-oncology and three concerned teledialysis. Most studies did not undertake randomisation, allocation concealment or selective outcome reporting making their risk of bias high. There were no randomised controlled trials and most sample sizes were small. Observational studies in telestroke showed favourable outcomes when comparing face-to-face and videoconferencing-assisted thrombolysis, with no significant differences between survival and intracerebral bleeds. Although tele-oncology has been used routinely for more than 20 years, there have been few formal studies. Home dialysis supervised through videoconferencing had similar patient outcomes compared to hospital dialysis. Telemedicine supervision of active treatment for rural patients appears promising, but more rigorous studies of effectiveness, feasibility and safety are required.			2015				7615
Interventions to improve the response of professionals to children exposed to domestic violence and abuse: A systematic review		Turner, W., Broad, J., Drinkwater, J., Firth, A., Hester, M., Stanley, N., Szilassy, E. and Feder, G.				child abuse review	child abuse review	Exposure of children to domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is a form of child maltreatment with short? and long?term behavioural and mental health impact. Health care professionals are generally uncertain about how to respond to domestic violence and are particularly unclear about best practice with regards to children's exposure and their role in a multiagency response. In this systematic review, we report educational and structural or whole?system interventions that aim to improve professionals understanding of, and response to, DVA survivors and their children. We searched 22 bibliographic databases and contacted topic experts for studies reporting quantitative outcomes for any type of intervention aiming to improve professional responses to disclosure of DVA with child involvement. We included interventions for physicians, nurses, social workers and teachers. Twenty?one studies met the inclusion criteria: three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 18 pre?post intervention surveys. There were 18 training and three system?level interventions. Training interventions generally had positive effects on participants knowledge, attitudes towards DVA and clinical competence. The results from the RCTs were consistent with the before?after surveys. Results from system?level interventions aimed to change organisational practice and inter?organisational collaboration demonstrates the benefit of coordinating system change in child welfare agencies with primary health care and other organisations. Implications for policy and research are discussed. © 2015 The Authors. Child Abuse Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. We searched 22 bibliographic databases and contacted topic experts Key Practitioner Messages We reviewed published evidence on interventions aimed at improving professionals practice with domestic violence survivors and their children. Training programmes were found to improve participants knowledge, attitudes and clinical competence up to a year after delivery. Key elements of successful training include interactive discussion, booster sessions and involving specialist domestic violence practitioners. Whole?system approaches aiming to promote coordination and collaboration across agencies appear promising but require funding and high levels of commitment from partners. Training programmes were found to improve participants' knowledge, attitudes and clinical competence up to a year after delivery (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)			2017				4650
Hydralazine and nitrates alone or combined for the management of chronic heart failure: A systematic review		Farag, M., Mabote, T., Shoaib, A., Zhang, J., Nabhan, A. F., Clark, A. L. and Cleland, J. G.				international journal of cardiology	international journal of cardiology	BACKGROUND: Hydralazine (H) and nitrates (Ns), when combined, reduced morbidity and mortality in some trials of chronic heart failure (CHF). It is unclear whether either agent used alone provides similar benefits. We aimed to evaluate the effects of H and/or N in patients with CHF. METHODS: A systematic review of randomised trials assessing the effects of H and N in CHF. For meta-analysis, only the endpoints of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were considered. RESULTS: In seven trials evaluating H&N in 2626 patients, combination therapy reduced all-cause mortality (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.55-0.95; p=0.02), and cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57-0.99; p=0.04) compared to placebo. However, when compared to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), combination therapy was associated with higher all-cause mortality (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.03-1.76; p=0.03), and cardiovascular mortality (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.04-1.81; p=0.03). For N alone, ten trials including 375 patients reported all-cause mortality and showed a trend to harm (13 deaths in those assigned to nitrates and 7 to placebo; OR 2.13; 95% CI 0.88-5.13; p=0.09). For H alone, three trials showed no difference in all-cause mortality compared to placebo (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.37-2.47; p=0.93), and two trials suggested inferiority to ACEI (OR 2.28; 95% CI 1.03-5.04; p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to placebo, H&N reduces mortality in patients with CHF. Whether race or background therapy influences benefit is uncertain, but on direct comparison H&N appears inferior to ACEI. There is little evidence to support the use of either drug alone in CHF.			2015				6944
The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a systematic review and economic evaluation		Loveman, E., Copley, V. R., Colquitt, J., Scott, D. A., Clegg, A., Jones, J., O'Reilly, K. M., Singh, S., Bausewein, C. and Wells, A.				health technology assessment (winchester, england)	health technology assessment (winchester, england)	BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a life-limiting lung disease that generally affects people over 60 years old. The main symptoms are shortness of breath and cough, and as the disease progresses there is a considerable impact on day-to-day life. Few treatments are currently available. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and an analysis of cost-effectiveness of treatments for IPF based on an economic model informed by systematic reviews of cost-effectiveness and quality of life. DATA SOURCES: Eleven electronic bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases, were searched from database inception to July 2013. Reference lists of relevant publications were also checked and experts consulted. METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references for the systematic reviews, extracted and checked data from the included studies and appraised their risk of bias. An advisory group was consulted about the choice of interventions until consensus was reached about eligibility. A narrative review with meta-analysis was undertaken, and a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed. A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate cost-effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for IPF. Parameter values were obtained from NMA and systematic reviews. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. The model perspective is NHS and Personal Social Services, and discount rate is 3.5% for costs and health benefits. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the review of clinical effectiveness, of which one evaluated azathioprine, three N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (alone or in combination), four pirfenidone, one BIBF 1120, one sildenafil, one thalidomide, two pulmonary rehabilitation, and one a disease management programme. Study quality was generally good, with a low risk of bias. The current evidence suggests that some treatments appear to be clinically effective. The model base-case results show increased survival for five pharmacological treatments, compared with best supportive care, at increased cost. General recommendations cannot be made of their cost-effectiveness owing to limitations in the evidence base. LIMITATIONS: Few direct comparisons of treatments were identified. An indirect comparison through a NMA was performed; however, caution is recommended in the interpretation of these results. In relation to the economic model, there is an assumption that pharmacological treatments have a constant effect on the relative rate of per cent predicted forced vital capacity decline. CONCLUSIONS: Few interventions have any statistically significant effect on IPF and a lack of studies on palliative care approaches was identified. Research is required into the effects of symptom control interventions, in particular pulmonary rehabilitation and thalidomide. Other research priorities include a well-conducted randomised controlled trial on inhaled NAC therapy and an updated evidence synthesis once the results of ongoing studies are reported.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction for people living with HIV/AIDS: preliminary review of intervention trial methodologies and findings		Riley, K. E. and Kalichman, S.				health psychology review	health psychology review	In the context of successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the management of HIV infection, the harmful effects of stress remain a significant threat. Stress may increase viral replication, suppress immune response, and impede adherence to ART. Stressful living conditions of poverty, facing a chronic life-threatening illness and stigma all exacerbate chronic stress in HIV-affected populations. Stress-reduction interventions are urgently needed for the comprehensive care of people living with HIV. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is one approach that has shown promise as an intervention for patients facing other medical conditions for reducing disease progression, psychological distress and maladaptive behaviours. In this systematic review, we identified 11 studies that have examined MBSR as an intervention for HIV-positive populations. Of the studies, six were randomised designs, one was a quasi-experimental design, and the remaining four were pre- and post-test designs. The preliminary outcomes support MBSR to decrease emotional distress with mixed evidence for impact on disease progression. Effect sizes were generally small to moderate in magnitude. The early findings from this emerging literature must be considered preliminary and support moving forward with more rigorous controlled trials, evaluated with objective assessments in longer-term follow-ups to determine the efficacy of MBSR for people living with HIV.			2015				10698
Systematic Review: Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer with respect to Stage of Disease		Hajibandeh, S. and Hajibandeh, S.				international scholarly research notices	international scholarly research notices	Background. Recent meta-analysis of 21 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) supports the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for nonmetastatic rectal carcinoma. In order to define a subgroup of patients who can potentially benefit from postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, this study aims to review trials investigating adjuvant chemotherapy with respect to stage of disease in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who had undergone surgery for cure (stage II and stage III). Methods. We searched electronic information sources to identify randomised trials evaluating adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stages II and III rectal cancer with overall survival or disease-free survival as outcomes. Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network notes on methodology were used to assess the methodological quality of the selected studies. Random-effects models were applied to calculate pooled outcome data. Results. Eight studies reporting total of 5527 patients were selected for analysis. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival and overall survival compared to surgery alone in both stage II and stage III cancer. Conclusions. This study indicates that both stage II and stage III rectal cancer patients may benefit from postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. However, the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who already had neoadjuvant chemoradiation still remain unknown.			2015				9144
Mortality Risk of Darbepoetin Alfa Versus Epoetin Alfa in Patients With CKD: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Wilhelm-Leen, E. R. and Winkelmayer, W. C.				american journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the national kidney foundation	american journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the national kidney foundation	BACKGROUND: Epoetin alfa (EPO) and darbepoetin alfa (DPO) are erythropoiesis-stimulating agents that are widely and interchangeably used for the treatment of anemia in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. No study has specifically compared the risks of hard study outcomes between EPO and DPO, including mortality. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis. SETTING & POPULATION: Patients enrolled in randomized trials comparing EPO versus DPO for the treatment of anemia in adults with chronic kidney disease, including those requiring dialysis. SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: We conducted a systematic search of the literature (PubMed, CENTRAL, SCOPUS, and EMBASE, all years) and industry resources, using predefined search terms and data abstraction tools. We then summarized key characteristics and findings of these trials and performed a random-effects meta-analysis of trials with at least 3 months' duration to identify the summary OR of mortality between patients randomly assigned to DPO versus EPO. INTERVENTION: DPO versus EPO. OUTCOME: All-cause mortality. RESULTS: We identified 9 trials that met the stated inclusion criteria. Overall, 2,024 patients were included in the meta-analysis, of whom 126 died during follow-up, which ranged from 20 to 52 weeks. We found no significant difference in mortality between patients randomly assigned to DPO versus EPO (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.88-2.01). No treatment heterogeneity across studies was detected (Q statistic=4.60; P=0.8). LIMITATIONS: Generalizability to nontrial populations is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Few trials directly comparing DPO and EPO have been conducted and follow-up was limited. In aggregate, no effect of specific erythropoiesis-stimulating agent on mortality was identified, but the confidence limits were wide and remained compatible with considerable harm from DPO. Absent adequately powered randomized trials, observational postmarketing comparative effectiveness studies comparing these erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are required to better characterize the long-term safety profiles of these agents.			2015				6366
Perioperative statin therapy in patients at high risk for cardiovascular morbidity undergoing surgery: a review		de Waal, B. A., Buise, M. P. and van Zundert, A. A.				british journal of anaesthesia	british journal of anaesthesia	Summary Statins feature documented benefits for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and are thought to improve perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing surgery. To assess the clinical outcomes of perioperative statin treatment in statin-naive patients undergoing surgery, a systematic review was performed. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: randomized controlled trials, patients aged ?18 yr undergoing surgery, patients not already on long-term statin treatment, reported outcomes including at least one of the following: mortality, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and length of hospital stay. The following randomized clinical trials were excluded: retrospective studies, trials without surgical procedure, trials without an outcome of interest, studies with patients on statin therapy before operation, or papers not written in English. The literature search revealed 16 randomized controlled studies involving 2275 patients. Pooled results showed a significant reduction in (i) mortality [risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.94, P=0.03], (ii) myocardial infarction (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38-0.76, P<0.001), (iii) perioperative atrial fibrillation (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.43-0.66, P<0.001), and (iv) length of hospital stay (days, mean difference -0.58, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.37, P<0.001) in patients treated with a statin. Subgroup analysis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery showed a decrease in the perioperative incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction. Consequently, anaesthetists should consider prescribing a standard-dose statin before operation to statin-naive patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, there are insufficient data to support final recommendations on perioperative statin therapy for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.			2015				10991
Arthroscopy in knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review of the literature		Barlow, T., Downham, C. and Griffin, D.				acta orthopaedica belgica	acta orthopaedica belgica	Knee arthroscopy has historically been a common treatment for knee osteoarthritis. A Cochrane review of the literature up to 2006 has resulted in guidance that arthroscopy is not effective in knee osteoarthritis. It cited that deficiencies in the evidence base prevented widespread acceptance of the recommendations. The aim of this review is to update the evidence base for the efficacy of arthroscopy in knee osteoarthritis. The authors searched CINHAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials that compared arthroscopic surgery in knee osteoarthritis with a control group (e.g. lavage, best medical care). The primary outcome measure was patient reported functional outcome. The study methodology was registered on Prospero, a systematic review register: Registration number CRD42012002891. Five randomised controlled trials included 516 patients, almost double the 271 episodes contained in previous reviews. Two high quality studies, according to the Jadad classification, published since the Cochrane review, addressed many of the methodological flaws criticised in previous reviews. However, certain subgroup analyses (e.g. patients with meniscal tears and mechanical symptoms) are still underpowered.			2015				5464
[Tamsulosin efficacy and security for conservative management of renal colic: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials]		Benítez Camps, M., Cerain Herrero, M. J., de Miguel Llorente, N., Martorell Sole, E., Flores Mateo, G., Pedro Pijoan, A. M. and Murillo-Huapaya, C.				medicina clinica	medicina clinica	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim is to evaluate tamsulosin efficacy and safety on the expulsion of distal ureteral stones compared to a standard therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted on PubMed, SCOPUS and The Cochrane Library so as to identify randomized and controlled clinical trials in patients treated with tamsulosin with ureteral stone expulsion and adverse events published until 2014 December, without language restriction. Treatment effect was calculated along with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI), using the variance inverse method for random effects. Heterogeneity was determined by I(2). Publication bias was assessed by Egger test. RESULTS: The search identified 480 articles. Thirty-eight met the selection criteria, a total of 3,107 patients. The relative risk (RR) of expulsion was 1.53 (95% CI 1.38-1.69; I(2)=71%.), while the RR of adverse effects was 1.79 (95% CI 1.19-2,71; I(2)=0). CONCLUSIONS: Tamsulosin treatment seems to bring on the expulsion of distal ureteral stones, although at the expense of an appreciable risk of side effects.			2015				9596
Comparative efficacy and safety of anticoagulants and aspirin for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism: A network meta-analysis		Sobieraj, D. M., Coleman, C. I., Pasupuleti, V., Deshpande, A., Kaw, R. and Hernandez, A. V.				thrombosis research	thrombosis research	OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature and to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended pharmacologic treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) through network meta-analysis (NMA). METHODS: A systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, through September 2014) and searching of reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials of patients who completed initial anticoagulant treatment for VTE and then randomized for the extension study; compared extension of anticoagulant treatment to placebo or active control; and reported at least one outcome of interest (VTE or a composite of major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding). A random-effects Frequentist approach to NMA was used to calculate relative risks with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Ten trials (n=11,079) were included. Risk of bias (assessed with the Cochrane tool) was low in most domains assessed across the included trials. Apixaban (2.5mg and 5mg), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, idraparinux and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) each significantly reduced the risk of VTE recurrence compared to placebo, ranging from a 73% reduction with idraparinux to 86% with VKAs. With exception of idraparinux, all active therapies significantly reduced VTE recurrence risk versus aspirin, ranging from a 73% reduction with either apixaban 2.5mg or rivaroxaban to 80% with VKAs. Apixaban and aspirin were the only therapies that did not increase composite bleeding risk significantly compared to placebo. All active therapies except aspirin increased risk of composite bleeding by 2 to 4-fold compared to apixaban 2.5mg, with no difference found between the two apixaban doses. CONCLUSION: Extended treatment of VTE is a reasonable approach to provide continued protection from VTE recurrence although bleeding risk is variable across therapeutic options. Our results indicate that apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, idraparinux and VKAs all reduced VTE recurrence when compared to placebo. Apixaban appears to have a more favorable safety profile compared to other therapies.			2015				10923
Intravenous Iron Sucrose versus Oral Iron in the Treatment of Pregnancy with Iron Deficiency Anaemia: A Systematic Review		Shi, Q., Leng, W., Wazir, R., Li, J., Yao, Q., Mi, C., Yang, J. and Xing, A.				gynecologic and obstetric investigation	gynecologic and obstetric investigation	BACKGROUND: Intravenous iron sucrose and oral iron therapy are the main therapies for iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), but there is still a debate regarding their efficacy and especially as to which one is the best choice during pregnancy. METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing patients treated with intravenous iron sucrose (intravenous group) with those treated with oral iron (oral group) for IDA during pregnancy was performed. The primary outcomes of interest were mean maternal haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes were treatment-related adverse events and foetal birth weight. RESULTS: Six randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 576 women, were included in the present review. Significant increases in haemoglobin [mean difference (MD), 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31-1.39; p = 0.002] and ferritin levels (MD, 63.32; 95% CI, 39.46-87.18; p < 0.00001) were observed in the intravenous group. Compared with the oral group, there were fewer adverse events in the intravenous group (risk ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34-0.73; p = 0.0003). There was no significant difference in birth weight between the two groups. CONCLUSION: For pregnant women who could not tolerate the side effects of oral treatment or required a rapid replacement of iron stores, intravenous iron sucrose was associated with fewer adverse events and was more effective than regular oral iron therapy. © 2015 S.

Antibiotic stewardship programmes in intensive care units: Why, how, and where are they leading us		Zhang, Y. Z. and Singh, S.				world journal of critical care medicine	world journal of critical care medicine	"Antibiotic usage and increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mount significant challenges to patient safety and management of the critically ill on intensive care units (ICU). Antibiotic stewardship programmes (ASPs) aim to optimise appropriate antibiotic treatment whilst minimising antibiotic resistance. Different models of ASP in intensive care setting, include ""standard"" control of antibiotic prescribing such as ""de-escalation strategies""through to interventional approaches utilising biomarker-guided antibiotic prescribing. A systematic review of outcomes related studies for ASPs in an ICU setting was conducted. Forty three studies were identified from MEDLINE between 1996 and 2014. Of 34 non-protocolised studies, [1 randomised control trial (RCT), 22 observational and 11 case series], 29 (85%) were positive with respect to one or more outcome: These were the key outcome of reduced antibiotic use, or ICU length of stay, antibiotic resistance, or prescribing cost burden. Limitations of non-standard antibiotic initiation triggers, patient and antibiotic selection bias or baseline demographic variance were identified. All 9 protocolised studies were RCTs, of which 8 were procalcitonin (PCT) guided antibiotic stop/start interventions. Five studies addressed antibiotic escalation, 3 de-escalation and 1 addressed both. Six studies reported positive outcomes for reduced antibiotic use, ICU length of stay or antibiotic resistance. PCT based ASPs are effective as antibiotic-stop (de-escalation) triggers, but not as an escalation trigger alone. PCT has also been effective in reducing antibiotic usage without worsening morbidity or mortality in ventilator associated pulmonary infection. No study has demonstrated survival benefit of ASP. Ongoing challenges to infectious disease management, reported by the World Health Organisation global report 2014, are high AMR to newer antibiotics, and regional knowledge gaps in AMR surveillance. Improved AMR surveillance data, identifying core aspects of successful ASPs that are transferable, and further well-conducted trials will be necessary if ASPs are to be an effective platform for delivering desired patient outcomes and safety through best antibiotic policy."			2015				10922

Peritoneal dialysis in patients with refractory congestive heart failure: a systematic review		Lu, R., Muciño-Bermejo, M. J., Ribeiro, L. C., Tonini, E., Estremadoyro, C., Samoni, S., Sharma, A., Zaragoza Galván Jde, J., Crepaldi, C., Brendolan, A., Ni, Z., Rosner, M. H. and Ronco, C.				cardiorenal medicine	cardiorenal medicine	BACKGROUND: Refractory congestive heart failure (RCHF) is associated with a high mortality rate and is a major contributor to hospital admissions. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an option to control volume overload and perhaps improve outcomes in this challenging patient population. The aim of this systematic review is to describe the relative risk-benefit ratio based on data reported regarding the use of PD in RCHF. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. An electronic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify relevant studies published from January 1951 to February 2014. Eligible studies selected were prospective or retrospective adult population studies on PD in the setting of RCHF. The following clinical outcomes were used to assess PD therapy: (1) hospitalization rates; (2) heart function; (3) renal function; (4) fluid overload, and (5) adverse clinical outcomes. SUMMARY: Of 864 citations, we excluded 843 citations and included 21 studies (n = 673 patients). After PD, hospitalization days declined significantly (p = 0.0001), and heart function improved significantly (left ventricular ejection fraction: p = 0.0013; New York Heart Association classification: p = 0.0000). There were no statistically significant differences in glomerular filtration rate after PD treatment in non-chronic kidney disease stage 5D patients (p = 0.1065). Among patients treated with PD, body weight decreased significantly (p = 0.0006). The yearly average peritonitis rate was 14.5%, and the average yearly mortality was 20.3%. KEY MESSAGES: This systematic review suggests that PD may be an effective and safe therapeutic tool for patients with RCHF.			2015				5922
Management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and coexisting asthma: A systematic review		Rix, I., Håkansson, K., Larsen, C. G., Frendø, M. and von Buchwald, C.				american journal of rhinology & allergy	american journal of rhinology & allergy	BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and asthma are strongly associated, and patients suffering from both diseases are often difficult to treat. However, no guidelines about the management of patients with CRS and coexisting asthma exist. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the management of CRSwNP and coexisting asthma. METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases and included clinical trials in which the clinical outcomes after medical or surgical treatment of patients with CRSwNP and asthma were assessed. The strength of the evidence for each outcome was graded on the basis of study quality and consistency in findings. RESULTS: We included seven trials in which the effect of montelukast, omalizumab, erythromycin, and functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) were studied in 317 adults with CRSwNP and asthma. All the interventions improved the majority of subjective and objective nasal outcomes significantly. However, few studies found significant effects on pulmonary function tests. The strength of the evidence was low overall. CONCLUSION: Both FESS and medical interventions with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs improved nasal outcomes, although their efficacy in relation to the lower airways remains unclear. A low number of studies met inclusion criteria for this systematic review, which emphasizes the need for high-quality trials to explore the treatment of patients with CRSwNP and coexisting asthma.			2015				5869
Levosimendan Treatment for Heart Failure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Gong, B., Li, Z. and Yat Wong, P. C.				journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia	journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia	OBJECTIVE: Emerging studies suggest that administration of levosimendan therapy may be better than dobutamine or placebo in decompensated heart failure. The authors performed an updated meta-analysis of trials to obtain the best estimates of the efficacy and safety of levosimendan for the initial treatment of decompensated heart failure. DESIGN: A meta-analysis. SETTING: Hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5,349 patients from 25 randomized controlled studies were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The authors performed a meta-analysis of trials comparing levosimendan therapy with dobutamine or placebo in patients with decompensated heart failure. Twenty-five trials, involving 5,349 patients, were included. Two reviewers performed independent article review and study quality assessment. Data on overall mortality, early-term mortality, midterm mortality, long-term mortality, efficacy outcomes, and adverse events were collected. Mortality outcomes were according to follow-up duration: early term (?30-day), midterm (30-day to?6-month), and long term (>6-month). Levosimendan was compared with dobutamine or placebo, calculating pooled relatives risk (RRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A random-effects model was selected for meta-analysis if there was significant heterogeneity. Levosimendan significantly reduced total mortality (17.1% versus 20.8%; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.94). Compared with dobutamine, levosimendan was associated with significant reduction in mortality at final follow-up (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97; I(2) = 7%; p = 0.02).Compared with placebo, levosimendan was associated with a nonsignificant trend in favor of placebo in mortality at final follow-up (11.6% versus 16.2%, RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56-1.01; p = 0.06), but it was associated with a significant reduction in long-term mortality (RR, 0.34; 95%CI, 0.15-0.76; p = 0.009). Compared with dobutamine or placebo, levosimendan therapy was associated with improvements in hemodynamically- and echocardiographically-derived cardiac parameters. Levosimendan therapy increased the risks of extrasystoles (RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.26-2.81), hypotension (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.15-1.53), and headache or migraine (RR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.54-2.43) when compared with control therapy. CONCLUSIONS: As compared to placebo or dobutamine, levosimendan in patients with heart failure seemed to have hemodynamic and cardiac benefits. It reduced total mortality and was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events.			2015				8286
Sodium bicarbonate versus isotonic saline solution to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy : a systematic review and meta-analysis		Zapata-Chica, C. A., Bello Marquez, D., Serna-Higuita, L. M., Nieto-Ríos, J. F., Casas-Arroyave, F. D. and Donado-Gómez, J. H.				colombia me?dica (cali, colombia)	colombia me?dica (cali, colombia)	INTRODUCTION: Contrast-induced nephropathy is one of the main causes of acute kidney injury and increased hospital-acquired morbidity and mortality. The use of sodium bicarbonate for nephroprotection has emerged as a preventative strategy; however, its efficacy is controversial compared to other strategies, such as hydration using 0.9% saline solution. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate vs. hydration using 0.9% saline solution to prevent contrast-induced acute kidney injury. METHODS: A systematic review of studies registered in the COCHRANE, PUBMED, MEDLINE, LILACS, SCIELO and EMBASE databases was conducted. Randomized controlled studies that evaluated the use of 0.9% saline solution vs. sodium bicarbonate to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy were included. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies (5,686 patients) were included. Sodium bicarbonate did not decrease the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (RD= 0.00; 95% CI= -0.02 to 0.03; p= 0.83; I(2)= 0%). No significant differences were found in the demand for renal replacement therapy (RD= 0.00; 95% CI= -0.01 to 0-01; I(2)= 0%; p= 0.99) or in mortality (RD= -0.00; 95% CI= -0.001 to 0.001; I(2)= 0%; p= 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Sodium bicarbonate administration is not superior to the use of 0.9% saline solution for preventing contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with risk factors, nor is it better at reducing mortality or the need for renal replacement therapy.			2015				6610
Effects of cervical headgear appliance: a systematic review		Henriques, F. P., Janson, G., Henriques, J. F. and Pupulim, D. C.				dental press journal of orthodontics	dental press journal of orthodontics	OBJECTIVE: Although much has been investigated about the effects of cervical headgear, there remains some controversy. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to disclose the actual effects of the cervical headgear appliance, based on articles of relevant quality. METHODS: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane databases. Inclusion criteria consisted of human studies written in English; published between 1970 and 2014; in which only the cervical headgear was used to correct Class II malocclusion; prospective or retrospective; with a clear description of cervical headgear effects; with a sample size of at least 15 individuals. No comparative studies, clinical cases or cases with dental extractions were included and the sample should be homogeneous. RESULTS: Initially, 267 articles were found. A total of 42 articles were selected by title and had their abstracts read. Finally, 12 articles were classified as with high quality and were used in this systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: The cervical headgear appliance proved efficient to correct Class II, Division 1 malocclusion. Its effects consisted in correction of the maxillomandibular relationship by restriction of maxillary anterior displacement; distalization and extrusion of maxillary molars; and slight maxillary expansion.			2015				5414
Interventions to improve the appropriate use of polypharmacy in older people: a Cochrane systematic review		Cooper, J. A., Cadogan, C. A., Patterson, S. M., Kerse, N., Bradley, M. C., Ryan, C. and Hughes, C. M.				bmj open	bmj open	OBJECTIVE: To summarise the findings of an updated Cochrane review of interventions aimed at improving the appropriate use of polypharmacy in older people. DESIGN: Cochrane systematic review. Multiple electronic databases were searched including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from inception to November 2013). Hand searching of references was also performed. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series analyses reporting on interventions targeting appropriate polypharmacy in older people in any healthcare setting were included if they used a validated measure of prescribing appropriateness. Evidence quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). SETTING: All healthcare settings. PARTICIPANTS: Older people (?65?years) with ?1 long-term condition who were receiving polypharmacy (?4 regular medicines). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the change in prevalence of appropriate polypharmacy and hospital admissions. Medication-related problems (eg, adverse drug reactions), medication adherence and quality of life were included as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: 12 studies were included: 8 RCTs, 2 cluster RCTs and 2 controlled before-and-after studies. 1 study involved computerised decision support and 11 comprised pharmaceutical care approaches across various settings. Appropriateness was measured using validated tools, including the Medication Appropriateness Index, Beers' criteria and Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions (STOPP)/ Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment (START). The interventions demonstrated a reduction in inappropriate prescribing. Evidence of effect on hospital admissions and medication-related problems was conflicting. No differences in health-related quality of life were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The included interventions demonstrated improvements in appropriate polypharmacy based on reductions in inappropriate prescribing. However, it remains unclear if interventions resulted in clinically significant improvements (eg, in terms of hospital admissions). Future intervention studies would benefit from available guidance on intervention development, evaluation and reporting to facilitate replication in clinical practice.			2015				6473
Efficacy of Pregabalin in Acute Postoperative Pain Under Different Surgical Categories: A Meta-Analysis		Lam, D. M., Choi, S. W., Wong, S. S., Irwin, M. G. and Cheung, C. W.				medicine	medicine	The efficacy of pregabalin in acute postsurgical pain has been demonstrated in numerous studies; however, the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of using pregabalin in various surgical procedures remain uncertain. We aim to assess the postsurgical analgesic efficacy and adverse events after pregabalin administration under different surgical categories using a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.A search of the literature was performed between August 2014 to April 2015, using PubMed, Ovid via EMBASE, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov with no limitation on publication year or language. Studies considered for inclusion were randomized controlled trials, reporting on relevant outcomes (2-, 24-hour pain scores, or 24 hour morphine-equivalent consumption) with treatment with perioperative pregabalin.Seventy-four studies were included. Pregabalin reduced pain scores at 2 hours in all categories: cardiothoracic (Hedge's g and 95%CI, -0.442 [-0.752 to -0.132], P?=?0.005), ENT (Hedge g and 95%CI, -0.684 [-1.051 to -0.316], P?<?0.0001), gynecologic (Hedge g, 95%CI, -0.792 [-1.235 to -0.350], P?<?0.0001), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Hedge g, 95%CI, -0.600 [-0.989 to -0.210], P?=?0.003), orthopedic (Hedge g, 95%CI, -0.507 [-0.812 to -0.202], P?=?0.001), spine (Hedge g, 95%CI, -0.972 [-1.537 to -0.407], P?=?0.001), and miscellaneous procedures (Hedge g, 95%CI, -1.976 [-2.654 to -1.297], P?<?0.0001). Pregabalin reduced 24-hour morphine consumption in gynecologic (Hedge g, 95%CI, -1.085 [-1.582 to -0.441], P?=?0.001), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Hedge g, 95%CI, -0.886 [-1.652 to -0.120], P?=?0.023), orthopedic (Hedge g, 95%CI, -0.720 [-1.118 to -0.323], P?<?0.0001), spine (Hedge g, 95%CI, -1.016 [-1.732 to -0.300], P?=?0.005), and miscellaneous procedures (Hedge g, 95%CI, -1.329 [-2.286 to -0.372], P?=?0.006). Pregabalin resulted in significant sedation in all surgical categories except ENT, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and gynecologic procedures. Postoperative nausea and vomiting was only significant after pregabalin in miscellaneous procedures.Analgesic effects and incidence of adverse effects of using pregabalin are not equal in different surgical categories.			2015				11118
Transcranial direct current stimulation facilitates motor learning post-stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Kang, N., Summers, J. J. and Cauraugh, J. H.				journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry	journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an attractive protocol for stroke motor recovery. The current systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effects of tDCS on motor learning post-stroke. Specifically, we determined long-term learning effects by examining motor improvements from baseline to at least 5?days after tDCS intervention and motor practise. 17 studies reported long-term retention testing (mean retention interval=43.8?days; SD=56.6?days) and qualified for inclusion in our meta-analysis. Assessing primary outcome measures for groups that received tDCS and motor practise versus sham control groups created 21 valid comparisons: (1) 16 clinical assessments and (2) 5 motor skill acquisition tests. A random effects model meta-analysis showed a significant overall effect size=0.59 (p<0.0001; low heterogeneity, T(2)=0.04; I(2)=22.75%; and high classic fail-safe N=240). 4 moderator variable analyses revealed beneficial effects of tDCS on long-term motor learning: (1) stimulation protocols: anodal on the ipsilesional hemisphere, cathodal on the contralesional hemisphere, or bilateral; (2) recovery stage: subacute or chronic stroke; (3) stimulation timing: tDCS before or during motor practise; and (4) task-specific training or conventional rehabilitation protocols. This robust meta-analysis identified novel long-term motor learning effects with tDCS and motor practise post-stroke.			2016				6645
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in cancer survivors		Johnson, J. A., Rash, J. A., Campbell, T. S., Savard, J., Gehrman, P. R., Perlis, M., Carlson, L. E. and Garland, S. N.				sleep medicine reviews	sleep medicine reviews	This review examined the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in people diagnosed with cancer. Studies were identified through November 2014 using multiple databases, clinical trial records, and bibliography searches. Inclusion was limited to randomized controlled trials of CBT-I conducted in individuals with a cancer diagnosis who had clinically relevant insomnia. The primary outcome variable was sleep efficiency (SE) as measured by sleep diary. Eight studies including data from 752 cancer survivors met inclusion criteria. CBT-I resulted in a 15.5% improvement in SE relative to control conditions (6.1%) from pre- to post-intervention, with a medium effect size (ES: d = 0.53). Overall, sleep latency was reduced by 22 min with an ES of d = 0.43, compared to a reduction of 8 min in the control conditions. Wake after sleep onset was reduced by 30 min with an ES of d = 0.41, compared to 13 min in the control conditions. Large effect sizes were observed for self-reported insomnia severity (d = 0.77) for those patients who received CBT-I, representing a clinically relevant eight point reduction. Effects were durable up to 6 mo. The quality of the evidence supports a strong recommendation for the use of CBT-I among cancer survivors.			2016				9635
Ketamine for Analgosedation in the Intensive Care Unit: A Systematic Review		Patanwala, A. E., Martin, J. R. and Erstad, B. L.				journal of intensive care medicine	journal of intensive care medicine	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence for the use of intravenous ketamine for analgosedation in the intensive care unit. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were queried from inception until July 2015. Search terms used included ketamine, intensive care, and critical care. The search retrieved 584 articles to be screened for inclusion. The intent was to include randomized controlled studies using sustained intravenous infusions (>24 hours) of ketamine in the critically ill patients. RESULTS: One trial evaluated opioid consumption as an outcome in postoperative critically ill patients who were randomized to ketamine or saline infusions. The mean cumulative morphine consumption at 48 hours was significantly lower in the ketamine group (58 ± 35 mg) compared to the morphine-only group (80 ± 37 mg; P < .05). Other trials showed the potential safety of ketamine in terms of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with traumatic brain injury, improved gastrointestinal motility, and decreased vasopressor requirements. The observational study and case reports suggest that ketamine is safe and effective and may have a role in patients who are refractory to other therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine use may decrease analgesic consumption in the intensive care unit. Additional trials are needed to further delineate the role of ketamine for analgosedation.			2017				4909
Quality of Life in Patients with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator: A Systematic Review		Tomzik, J., Koltermann, K. C., Zabel, M., Willich, S. N. and Reinhold, T.				frontiers in cardiovascular medicine	frontiers in cardiovascular medicine	Despite the indisputable mortality advantages of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), no consensus exists regarding their impact on quality of life (QoL). This systematic review investigates differences in QoL between patients with ICDs and controls. We systematically searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and PsychINFO databases. Articles were included if they were published after the year 2000 and reported on original studies with a control group. Five randomized controlled trials with a total of 5,138 patients and 10 observational studies with a total of 1,513 patients met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies found comparable QoL for ICD recipients and patients in the control groups, three studies found an increased QoL for ICD patients, and three studies found a decreased QoL for ICD patients. The question of whether QoL relates to ICD therapy cannot be answered conclusively due to the heterogeneity of the existing studies. Lower QoL was apparent among patients with an ICD who experienced several device discharges. Medical staff should be particularly aware of the signs of both psychological and physical disorders in these patients. Further investigations on QoL in ICD patients are desirable, but ethical reasons restrict the conduct of randomized trials.			2015				6576
Lymphomatosis cerebri: a rare form of primary central nervous system lymphoma. Analysis of 7 cases and systematic review of the literature		Izquierdo, C., Velasco, R., Vidal, N., Sánchez, J. J., Argyriou, A. A., Besora, S., Graus, F. and Bruna, J.				neuro-oncology	neuro-oncology	BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphomas may present as diffuse, nonenhancing infiltrative lesions. This rare variant is termed lymphomatosis cerebri (LC). We did a systematic review and analysis of the literature, adding our own cases, to better characterize LC in order to improve early diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and hospital databases were reviewed. Information was extracted regarding demographic, clinical, histological, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), neuroimaging, and treatment variables. The impact of single parameters on overall survival (OS) was determined by applying univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were included (median age: 58 y; range: 28-80 y). At consultation, 52% of patients had a poor KPS. The most common presenting symptom was cognitive decline (59.5%). Imaging studies showed supratentorial and infratentorial infiltration in 55% of patients and bilateral hemispheric involvement in 95%. CSF pleocytosis was present in 51.5% of the patients. Median time to diagnosis was 4.5 (range: 1-30) months, and the diagnosis was not established until autopsy for 33% of patients. The median OS was 2.95 (range: 0.33-56) months; however, those patients who received methotrexate had a median OS of 13.8 (range: 0.7-56) months. Analysis identified KPS ? 70 (HR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.114-0.894; P = .03) and treatment with methotrexate (HR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.041-0.886; P = .034) as independent favorable prognostic factors, whereas T-cell lymphoma was independently related with a worse outcome (HR: 6.62; 95% CI: 1.317-33.316; P = .022). CONCLUSIONS: LC is a misdiagnosed entity associated with considerable diagnostic delay. MRI evidence of bilateral hemispheric involvement and CSF pleocytosis should be alerts for this diagnosis. Treatment with methotrexate-based chemotherapy must be considered, especially for patients with good KPS.			2016				8086
The use of alpha-1 adrenergic blockers in children with distal ureterolithiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Glina, F. P., Castro, P. M., Monteiro, G. G., Del Guerra, G. C., Glina, S., Mazzurana, M. and Bernardo, W. M.				international braz j urol : official journal of the brazilian society of urology	international braz j urol : official journal of the brazilian society of urology	INTRODUCTION: Urinary lithiasis is the main urologic cause of emergency treatment in adult patient. In the past years, the incidence in children population has increased. However, literature about the use of alpha-1 adrenergic blockers in pediatric population with distal ureterolithiasis is still scarce. The drug acts by decreasing ureter contractions, especially in the distal portion, facilitating calculus expulsion. OBJECTIVE: This review has the objective to evaluate the use of alpha-1 adrenergic blockers as medical expulsive treatment in children with distal ureterolithiasis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: An electronic literature search was performed using the MEDLINE, COCHRANE, and LILACS databases. We further searched manually the references of the primary studies. Searches were concluded on October 4th, 2014. Articles were selected, independently and in pairs, by the respective titles and summaries. Any divergence was resolved by consensus. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists increased the probability of calculus expulsion by 27% (NNT=4). Calculi smaller than 5mm, increased by 33% (NNT=3). Larger than 5mm, increased by 34% (NNT=3). CONCLUSION: Alpha-1 adrenergic blocker use is related with a greater incidence of expulsion of ureteral calculi, smaller or greater than 5mm, and fewer episodes of pain when compared to ibuprofen. However it is necessary larger samples to enhance the power analysis of the expulsion of ureteral calculi larger than 5mm and the episodes of pain. PATIENT SUMMARY: This review analyzed the outcome of alpha adrenergic antagonist in children with ureteral calculi. We conclude that it is the best medicine for use, since it helps the expulsion of the stone.			2015				8867
Radiopharmaceuticals for Palliation of Bone Pain in Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Metastatic to Bone: A Systematic Review		Jong, J. M., Oprea-Lager, D. E., Hooft, L., de Klerk, J. M., Bloemendal, H. J., Verheul, H. M., Hoekstra, O. S. and van den Eertwegh, A. J.				european urology	european urology	CONTEXT: The majority of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer develop bone metastatic disease. It is often challenging to optimally palliate malignant bone pain. In case of multifocal pain due to diffuse osteoblastic metastases, treatment with bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals can be considered. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of different bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals for palliation of malignant bone pain from prostate cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed (Medline) and Embase databases were searched for publications on 89-strontium-chloride ((89)Sr), 153-samarium-EDTMP ((153)Sm), 186-rhenium-HEDP ((186)Re), 188-rhenium-HEDP ((188)Re), and 223-radium-chloride ((223)Ra). Randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies were included. Metastatic bone pain had to be registered as outcome measure for prostate cancer patients separately. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: This review included 36 articles of which 13 randomised trials and 23 prospective studies. Of all trials, 10 studies used (89)Sr, 7 (153)Sm, 12 (186)Re, 2 (188)Re, and 2 (223)Ra; three reported on a combination of different radionuclides. Only a few trials contained a blinding procedure and several studies contained incomplete follow-up or lack of intention-to-treat analysis. It was not possible to calculate a pooled estimate of pain response to treatment with any of the radionuclides because different definitions of pain response were used. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, pain response percentages greater than 50-60% were seen with each radionuclide. Haematological toxicity was reported in 26 of the 36 studies and more than half of these trials stated no grade 3/4 leukopenia or thrombocytopenia occurred. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report we reviewed the efficacy of bone-seeking radionuclides for treating bone pain from metastatic prostate cancer. Overall, treatment with bone-seeking radionuclides resulted in pain responses greater than 50-60%.			2016				7438
Compression Therapy in the Prevention of Postthrombotic Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Tie, H. T., Luo, M. Z., Luo, M. J., Li, K., Li, Q. and Wu, Q. C.				medicine	medicine	Although compression therapy has been widely used after deep vein thrombosis (DVT), its efficacy in prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) remains disputable. We aimed to update the meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the effect of compression therapy on the prevention of PTS in adult patients after DVT.PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the preventive effect of compression therapy on PTS in adult patients after DVT were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of PTS. All meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models regardless of the heterogeneity. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were also performed to examine the robustness of the pooled effects according to our predesigned plan. Potential publication bias was assessed.Eight RCTs with 1598 patients were included. Overall, compression therapy could significantly reduce the incidence of PTS (estimate 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.90; P?=?0.007). However, it was only associated with a reduction in the incidence of mild/moderate PTS (relative risk [RR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.93; P?=?0.019) but not in the incidence of severe PTS (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.27-1.50; P?=?0.31). Additionally, compression therapy failed to reduce the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65-1.27; P?=?0.58), the incidence of ulceration (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.36-1.53; P?=?0.42), or mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.72-1.37; P?=?0.96). No publication bias was observed.Current evidence still supports compression therapy to be a clinical practice for prophylaxis of PTS in adult patients after DVT. However, our findings should be cautiously interpreted because of heterogeneity and hence more large-scale and well-designed RCTs are still warranted.			2015				8975
Effects of supplementation with pomegranate juice on plasma C-reactive protein concentrations: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials		Sahebkar, A., Gurban, C., Serban, A., Andrica, F. and Serban, M. C.				phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology	phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology	BACKGROUND: Pomegranate juice (PJ) has a high content of antioxidants and bioactive polyphenols, being widely used for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive effects. PURPOSE: The objective of this meta-analysis consisted in investigating the impact of PJ on plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. METHODS: The search included SCOPUS, Medline and two Iranian bibliographic databases namely MagIran and Scientific Information Database (from inception to December 09, 2014) to identify prospective trials for investigating the impact of pomegranate preparations on serum concentrations of CRP. Two independent reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, methods and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 427 participants in the selected studies, 216 were allocated to PJ groups, and 211 to control group. Meta-analysis of data from 5 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) arms did not provide compelling evidence as to a significant CRP-lowering effect of supplementation with pomegranate juice (WMD: -0.22 mg/l, 95% CI: -0.45, 0.01, p = 0.061). The impact of pomegranate juice on plasma CRP levels was found to be independent of duration of supplementation (slope: 0.003; 95% CI: -0.005, 0.011; p = 0.444). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this meta-analysis of data from 5 prospective trials did not indicate a significant effect of PJ on plasma CRP levels, and this effect was independent of duration of supplementation.			2016				9792
Respiratory muscle endurance after training in athletes and non-athletes: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Sales, A. T., Fregonezi, G. A., Ramsook, A. H., Guenette, J. A., Lima, I. N. and Reid, W. D.				physical therapy in sport : official journal of the association of chartered physiotherapists in sports medicine	physical therapy in sport : official journal of the association of chartered physiotherapists in sports medicine	The objectives of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of respiratory muscle training (RMT) on respiratory muscle endurance (RME) and to determine the RME test that demonstrates the most consistent changes after RMT. Electronic searches were conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, COCHRANE CENTRAL, CINHAL and SPORTDiscus. The PEDro scale was used for quality assessment and meta-analysis were performed to compare effect sizes of different RME tests. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Isocapnic hyperpnea training was performed in 40% of the studies. Meta-analysis showed that RMT improves RME in athletes (P = 0.0007) and non-athletes (P = 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed differences among tests; maximal sustainable ventilatory capacity (MSVC) and maximal sustainable threshold loading tests demonstrated significant improvement after RMT (P = 0.007; P = 0.003 respectively) compared to the maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) (P = 0.11) in athletes whereas significant improvement after RMT was only shown by MSVC in non-athletes. The effect size of MSVC was greater compared to MVV in studies that performed both tests. The meta-analysis results provide evidence that RMT improves RME in athletes and non-athletes and MSVC test that examine endurance over several minutes are more sensitive to improvement after RMT.			2016				6679
Effectiveness and safety of prolotherapy injections for management of lower limb tendinopathy and fasciopathy: a systematic review		Sanderson, L. M. and Bryant, A.				journal of foot and ankle research	journal of foot and ankle research	INTRODUCTION: The aim of this review was to identify and evaluate existing research to determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of prolotherapy injections for treatment of lower limb tendinopathy and fasciopathy. REVIEW: Nine databases were searched (Medline, Science Direct, AMED, Australian Medical Index, APAIS-Health, ATSIhealth, EMBASE, Web of Science, OneSearch) without language, publication or data restrictions for all relevant articles between January 1960 and September 2014. All prospective randomised and non-randomised trials, cohort studies, case-series, cross-sectional studies and controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of one or more prolotherapy injections for tendinopathy or fasciopathy at or below the superior aspect of the tibia/fibula were included. Methodological quality of studies was determined using a modified evaluation tool developed by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group. Data analysis was carried out to determine the mean change of outcome measure scores from baseline to final follow-up for trials with no comparative group, and for randomised controlled trials, standardised mean differences between intervention groups were calculated. Pooled SMD data were calculated where possible to determine the statistical heterogeneity and overall effect for short-, intermediate- and long-term data. Adverse events were also reported. Two hundred and three studies were identified, eight of which met the inclusion criteria. These were then grouped according to tendinopathy or fasciopathy being treated with prolotherapy injections: Achilles tendinopathy, plantar fasciopathy and Osgood-Schlatter disease. The methodological quality of the eight included studies was generally poor, particularly in regards to allocation concealment, intention to treat analysis and blinding procedures. Results of the analysis provide limited support for the hypothesis that prolotherapy is effective in both reducing pain and improving function for lower limb tendinopathy and fasciopathy, with no study reporting a mean negative or non-significant outcome following prolotherapy injection. The analysis also suggests prolotherapy injections provide equal or superior short-, intermediate- and long-term results to alternative treatment modalities, including eccentric loading exercises forAchilles tendinopathy, platelet-rich plasma for plantar fasciopathy and usual care or lignocaine injections for Osgood-Schlatter disease. No adverse events following prolotherapy injections were reported in any study in this review. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusions of this review were derived from the best available scientific evidence. It is intended that the results of this study will assist clinical decision-making by practitioners. The results of this review found limited evidence that prolotherapy injections are a safe and effective treatment for Achilles tendinopathy, plantar fasciopathy and Osgood-Schlatter disease, however more robust research using large, methodologically-sound randomised controlled trials is required to substantiate these findings.			2015				9520
Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Device and Novel Oral Anticoagulants Versus Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials		Briceno, D. F., Villablanca, P., Cyrille, N., Massera, D., Bader, E., Manheimer, E., Aagaard, P., Ferrick, K., Gross, J., Kim, S. G., Krumerman, A., Palma, E., Guttenplan, N., Romero, J., Fisher, J., Garcia, M., Natale, A. and Di Biase, L.				circulation. arrhythmia and electrophysiology	circulation. arrhythmia and electrophysiology	BACKGROUND: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia. Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke; therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of different approaches to prevent this major complication. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted electronic database searches of phase III randomized controlled trials. The groups were novel oral anticoagulants, Watchman left atrial appendage occlusion device (DEVICE), and warfarin. Efficacy outcomes were stroke or systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality. Safety outcome was major bleeding and procedure-related complications. A subgroup analysis of the elderly population was done. We used random-effects model to compare pooled outcomes and tested for heterogeneity. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for each outcome. Seven randomized controlled trials (n=73?978) were included. There was a significant difference favoring novel oral anticoagulants for systemic embolism (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.97; P=0.01), all-cause mortality (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.94; P<0.001), and safety outcomes (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97; P=0.026) compared with warfarin. No difference was seen between DEVICE and warfarin for efficacy end points; however, DEVICE had more complications (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.14-3.01; P=0.012). In the elderly (6 randomized controlled trials, n=30?699), systemic embolism was favored with novel oral anticoagulants over warfarin (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.87; P?0.001). No evidence of significant publication bias was found. CONCLUSIONS: Novel oral anticoagulants is superior to warfarin for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. This benefit was also observed in the elderly population. DEVICE is a reasonable noninferior alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention, but cautious use is essential given safety concerns.			2015				10094
Effects of balance training on post-sprained ankle joint instability		Faizullin, I. and Faizullina, E.				the international journal of risk & safety in medicine	the international journal of risk & safety in medicine	"BACKGROUND: Ankle sprain is a medical condition when ankle ligaments are totally or partially torn. The primary cause of ankle sprain is sharp movements like turning or rolling the foot [1]. The ankle sprain needs to be treated right after the trauma, because if not treated it could lead to decreased stability of the ankle joint and lead to chronic ankle instability, which is characterized by increased risk of the ankle sprain [2] . We suppose that rehabilitation after the ankle sprain could significantly increase the performance of sportsmen. OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of balance exercise training on instable ankle due to the previous ankle sprain injury. In addition, the secondary aim of this systematic review was to find the effectiveness of different balance training exercises on instable ankle in order to find better opportunities for rehabilitation of sportsmen. METHODS: The studies were selected from PubMed and Scopus using the library of the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (further-UB FAU), we used full texts, and only texts in English were included in this review. The literature search was conducted at the end of December 2014. Texts included randomised controlled trials, which were published in the last 5 years (2009-2014). The literature was included in this review only if it was published in English and if the randomised controlled trial was conducted in the study and if the full text was available from UB FAU. The articles, which were found only in PubMed search, were excluded during Scopus search.PubMed search.First MeSH term was ""Balance training for the ankle sprain"" and 44 articles were found in PubMed. Then 29 articles were filtered by title and excluded from the study. Remaining 15 articles were assessed reading their abstracts, 6 of them were excluded and only 4 articles were left. The second MeSH term was ""Balance training for ankle injury"". Four additional articles were found by initial search. Two of them were filtered by the title and 2 were excluded at the stage of reading abstracts. The third MeSH term was ""Balance exercises for instable ankle"". One additional article was found by initial search and was excluded after reading the abstract.Scopus search.The same MeSH terms were used as in PubMed search. With the first MeSH term one article was found and filtered by the title. With the second MeSH term no results were found in the initial search and with the third term 2 articles were picked up by the initial search. One of these articles was filtered by the title. The other one was filtered after reading the abstract. Overall 8 articles were taken into consideration for conducting a systematic review. Nevertheless, three of them could not be downloaded for free even using UB FAU up to the 28th of December, 2014. Thus, five articles were taken for the systematic review. After reading all 5 articles, one article by Maraike Alice Wortmann and Carrie L. Docherty was excluded from the study because it was a systematic review per se and at the same time it was not mentioned neither in the article title, nor in the abstract that the current study was a systematic review [3]. Also the article by Borreani et al. 2014 [4] was excluded after reading the paragraph ""Methods"" as this was not an RCT but a descriptive study. Therefore, 3 articles were taken for conducting a systematic review. RESULTS: The first article by Janssen et al. 2011 [5] was a 3-way randomised controlled trial with 1 year follow-up. Participants aged from 12 to 70 years used this intervention. People with active participation in sports with a lateral ankle sprain during the last 2 months were eligible for inclusion in the study. Participants were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 undertook an 8 week neuromuscular training programme. Group 2 wore sports brace during their sport activities for the duration of 1 year, and group 3 was a control group and used the combination of neuromuscular training program and wore sports brace for 8 weeks. There were 122 participants in the neuromuscular training group, 126 in the brace group and 136 in combined group. The drawback of this intervention was that there was no control over the care provid.In the second study by Ben Moussa Zouita, A et al. 2013 [6] the objective was to investigate how the proprioceptive exercises effect the postural balance and isokinetic strength in athletes with ankle sprain. 16 participants were recruited in the study and divided into two groups. The experimental group consisted of 8 participants with unilateral ankle sprain symptoms. The control group included another 8 participants with bilateral non-injured ankles. The training programme included 24 sessions during 8 weeks, every session lasted between 20 and 30 minutes. Four prescribed exercises were used during the intervention: one exercise without any material, one exercise with a ball only, one exercise with a balance board only and one exercise with a ball and a balance board. As a result, after 8 weeks of proprioceptive rehabilitation a significant improvement in extensor and flexor strength of ankle at a speed of 60-deg/sec was registered.The third study by Emery, Meeuwisse 2010 [7] was aimed to examine the effectiveness of the neuromuscular prevention strategy in youth soccer players. The inclusion criteria were adolescents between 13 and 18 years of age. The exclusion criteria were injury within 6 weeks and the history of systemic disease in anamnesis (i.e. cerebral palsy, head injury). 82 soccer teams were invited to take part in the intervention. 12 trainers declined the invitation, other 10 teams declined participation. Overall 60 teams took part in the intervention programme. The teams were randomised by a club. 32 training group teams (n = 380 players) and 28 control group players (n = 364 players) took part in the intervention. The training programme included dynamic stretching exercises, agility, jumping and balance and eccentric strength. The control programme was a standardized warm-up including static, dynamic and aerobic components and home-based stretching programme using 16-inch diameter wobble board used for 15 minutes during exercises. The injury rate in the training group was 2.08 injuries/1000 player-hours, and in the control group 3.35 injuries/1000 player-hours. The neuromuscular training programme was protective in injuries of youth soccer players. CONCLUSIONS: Balance training is an effective training method for rehabilitation of instable ankle. Different approaches to balance training provide in general similar improvement for sprained ankle.Implications for future studies:More RCTs on chronic ankle instability are needed with large sample size and use of different intensities of exercises. It would be better for the UB FAU to provide access to articles so that students and researches could download articles for free from different electronic sources."			2015				10462
The effectiveness of low-level laser therapy for nonspecific chronic low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Huang, Z., Ma, J., Chen, J., Shen, B., Pei, F. and Kraus, V. B.				arthritis research & therapy	arthritis research & therapy	BACKGROUND: In recent decades, low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been widely used to relieve pain caused by different musculoskeletal disorders. Though widely used, its reported therapeutic outcomes are varied and conflicting. Results similarly conflict regarding its usage in patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). This study investigated the efficacy of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) for the treatment of NSCLBP by a systematic literature search with meta-analyses on selected studies. METHOD: MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science and Cochrane Library were systematically searched from January 2000 to November 2014. Included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) written in English that compared LLLT with placebo treatment in NSCLBP patients. The efficacy effect size was estimated by the weighted mean difference (WMD). Standard random-effects meta-analysis was used, and inconsistency was evaluated by the I-squared index (I(2)). RESULTS: Of 221 studies, seven RCTs (one triple-blind, four double-blind, one single-blind, one not mentioning blinding, totaling 394 patients) met the criteria for inclusion. Based on five studies, the WMD in visual analog scale (VAS) pain outcome score after treatment was significantly lower in the LLLT group compared with placebo (WMD?=?-13.57 [95 % CI?=?-17.42, -9.72], I(2)?=?0 %). No significant treatment effect was identified for disability scores or spinal range of motion outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that LLLT is an effective method for relieving pain in NSCLBP patients. However, there is still a lack of evidence supporting its effect on function.			2015				9531
Antioxidant therapy in acute, chronic and post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis		Gooshe, M., Abdolghaffari, A. H., Nikfar, S., Mahdaviani, P. and Abdollahi, M.				world journal of gastroenterology	world journal of gastroenterology	AIM: To investigate the efficacy and adverse effects of antioxidant therapy in acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP) and post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP). METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane library database, and Evidence-based medicine/clinical trials published before August 2014 were searched. Clinical and laboratory outcomes of randomized trials of antioxidant therapy in patients with AP, CP and PEP were included. The methodological quality of the trials was assessed by the Jadad score based on the description of randomization, blinding, and dropouts (withdrawals). The results of the studies were pooled and meta-analyzed to provide estimates of the efficacy of antioxidant therapy. RESULTS: Thirty four trials out of 1069 potentially relevant studies with data for 4898 patients were eligible for inclusion. Antioxidant therapy significantly reduced the length of hospital stay in AP patients {mean difference -2.59 d (95%CI: -4.25-(-0.93)], P = 0.002}. Although, antioxidant therapy had no significant effect on serum C reactive protein (CRP) after 5-7 d in AP patients [mean difference -9.57 (95%CI: -40.61-21.48, P = 0.55], it significantly reduced serum CRP after 10 d {mean difference -45.16 [95%CI: -89.99-(-0.33)], P = 0.048}. In addition, antioxidant therapy had no significant effect on CP-induced pain [mean difference -2.13 (95%CI: -5.87-1.6), P = 0.26]. Antioxidant therapy had no significant effects on the incidence of all types of PEP [mean difference 1.05 (95%CI: 0.74-1.5), P = 0.78], severe PEP [mean difference 0.92 (95%CI: 0.43-1.97), P = 0.83], moderate PEP [mean difference 0.82 (95%CI: 0.54-1.23), P = 0.33], and mild PEP [mean difference 1.33 (95%CI: 0.99-1.78), P = 0.06]. Furthermore, while antioxidant therapy had no significant effect on serum amylase after less than 8 h sampling [mean difference -20.61 (95%CI: -143.61-102.39), P = 0.74], it significantly reduced serum amylase close to 24-h sampling {mean difference -16.13 [95%CI: -22.98-(-9.28)], P < 0.0001}. CONCLUSION: While there is some evidence to support antioxidant therapy in AP, its effect on CP and PEP is still controversial.			2015				8884
A systematic review of placebo-controlled trials of topiramate: How useful is a multiple-indications review for evaluating the adverse events of an antiepileptic drug?		Donegan, S., Dixon, P., Hemming, K., Tudur-Smith, C. and Marson, A.				epilepsia	epilepsia	"OBJECTIVE: Topiramate (TPM) is an antiepileptic drug that is also used for other indications (e.g., migraine). Adverse event (AE) data from epilepsy trials could be supplemented by data from trials in other indications. Combining data across trials and indications is a novel method for evaluating AEs. We conducted a multiple-indications review by systematically reviewing randomized placebo-controlled trials of TPM, to compare the nervous system AEs of TPM in epilepsy with those in other indications. METHODS: Randomized placebo-controlled trials of TPM including patients with any indication were included. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 2, 2012) and MEDLINE (1966-February 2012). Two authors assessed eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. For each reported nervous system AE, we extracted event rates, applied random-effects inverse-variance meta-analysis (pooling within-indications then across-indications), and assessed within- and across-indication heterogeneity. RESULTS: Ninety trials, including 16 epilepsy trials, were included. A difference was detected between TPM and placebo for three events (i.e., drooling, dysgeusia, and hypoesthesia) that were not reported in epilepsy trials but were reported by other trials. A difference between TPM and placebo was detected for speech disorder using epilepsy trials but not when combining all trials. For two events (i.e., cognitive disorder and ""language problems""), no difference was detected between TPM and placebo when using epilepsy trials alone, but a difference was identified using all trials. A difference was detected between TPM and placebo for six events (i.e., ataxia, disturbance in attention, dizziness, memory impairment, paraesthesia, and somnolence) when using epilepsy trials alone, and using all trials. SIGNIFICANCE: Including trials of any indication enabled detection of differences that would have been missed using epilepsy trials alone. Multiple-indications reviews can improve the synthesis of AEs for antiepileptic drugs."			2015				9330
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Ashrafian, H., Harling, L., Toma, T., Athanasiou, C., Nikiteas, N., Efthimiou, E., Darzi, A. and Athanasiou, T.				obesity surgery	obesity surgery	BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has a rising global prevalence. Although it is vastly outnumbered by type 2 diabetes mellitus rates, it remains a persistent worldwide source of morbidity and mortality. Increasingly, its sufferers are afflicted by obesity and its complications. The objective of the study is to quantify the effects of bariatric surgery on T1DM by appraising the primary outcomes of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin requirements and body mass index (BMI). Secondary outcomes included blood pressure, triglycerides and cholesterol biochemistry. METHODS: A systematic review of studies reporting pre-operative and post-operative outcomes in T1DM patients undergoing bariatric surgery was done. Data were meta-analysed using random effects modelling. Subgroup analysis and quality scoring were assessed. RESULTS: Bariatric surgery in obese T1DM patients is associated with a significant reduction in insulin requirement (-48.95 units, 95 % CI of -56.27, -41.62), insulin requirement per kilogramme (-0.391, 95 % CI of -0.51, -0.27), HbA1c (-0.933, 95 % CI of -1.604, -0.262) and BMI (-11.04 kg/m(2), 95 % CI of -13.49, -8.59). Surgery is also associated with a statistically significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a significant beneficial rise in HDL. Heterogeneity in these results was high, and study quality was low overall. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery in obese T1DM patients is associated with a significant improvement in insulin requirement and a significant though modest effect on HbA1c. These early results require further substantiation with future studies focusing on higher levels of evidence. This may offer a deeper understanding of diabetogenesis and can contribute to better selection and stratification of diabetic patients for metabolic surgery and future metabolic treatment strategies.			2016				6957
The Relationship between Testosterone Replacement Therapy and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: A Systematic Review		Kathrins, M., Doersch, K., Nimeh, T., Canto, A., Niederberger, C. and Seftel, A.				urology	urology	OBJECTIVES: To systematically review prospective trials evaluating the clinical effects of testosterone replacement therapy on lower urinary tract symptoms and prostate volume. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a literature review through PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from 1994 to 2015 for prospective trials of hypogonadal men with benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms treated with testosterone replacement therapy. We evaluated the abstracts for outcomes related to International Prostate Symptom Score, prostate volume, and urodynamic parameters. RESULTS: An original cohort of 3079 abstracts was reviewed. 35 trials were selected for inclusion. The majority of trials reviewed found no significant prostate growth due to testosterone replacement therapy. Studies of men with baseline mild lower urinary tract symptoms demonstrated either no change or an improvement in symptoms after treatment. There was a lack of relevant urodynamic studies. Trials of men with the metabolic syndrome demonstrated uniform improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms. 46% of all the trials identified included exclusion criteria for baseline severe-range lower urinary tract symptoms or other signs of obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The current literature demonstrates scant support for a causative relationship between testosterone replacement therapy, de-novo or worsening lower urinary tract symptoms, and prostate volume. Furthermore, our review found an absence of high quality evidence that would support guideline recommendations that testosterone replacement therapy is relatively contraindicated in men with severe-range lower urinary tract symptoms. Future clinical trials with more inclusive voiding criteria are needed.			2016				9061
Comparative Immunogenicity of TNF Inhibitors: Impact on Clinical Efficacy and Tolerability in the Management of Autoimmune Diseases. A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Thomas, S. S., Borazan, N., Barroso, N., Duan, L., Taroumian, S., Kretzmann, B., Bardales, R., Elashoff, D., Vangala, S. and Furst, D. E.				biodrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy	biodrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy	BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are a mainstay in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as in the management of spondyloarthritis (SpA) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Unfortunately, a portion of patients taking these drugs require escalating doses within the approved label to achieve response, while others lose response altogether. This may be due to the development of antibodies against TNFi agents. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to examine the immunogenicity of TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, golimumab, and certolizumab) in RA, SpA, and IBD, and to examine the potential effect of anti-drug antibodies (ADABs) on the loss of clinical response through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library) to identify studies examining the immunogenicity of TNF inhibitors in autoimmune diseases between 1966 and 31 December 2013. Inclusion criteria required that studies be in English, be randomized controlled trials, observational studies, or case reports involving more than five patients, and that the patients be aged 18 years or older. Studies were excluded if they were strictly genetic with no clinical correlate, if the patients had concomitant cancer within 5 years of the study, or if the patients had a renal disease requiring dialysis. Double extraction was followed by a third extraction if needed. Consensus was reached by discussion when disagreements occurred. Random-effect models were generated for the meta-analysis of 68 studies to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of the ADAB effects on TNF inhibitor response. Regression analysis was used to compare among the drugs and diseases. RESULTS: A total of 68 studies (14,651 patients) matched the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Overall, the cumulative incidence of ADABs was 12.7 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 9.5-16.7]. Of the patients using infliximab, 25.3 % (95 % CI 19.5-32.3) developed ADABs compared with 14.1 % (95 % CI 8.6-22.3) using adalimumab, 6.9 % (95 % CI 3.4-13.5) for certolizumab, 3.8 % (95 % CI 2.1-6.6) for golimumab, and 1.2 % (95 % CI 0.4-3.8) for etanercept. ADABs reduced the odds of clinical response by 67 % overall, although most of the data were derived from articles involving infliximab (nine) and adalimumab (eight). The summary effect for infliximab yielded an estimated OR (with ADABs vs. without) of 0.42 (95 % CI 0.30-0.58); the summary effect for adalimumab yielded an estimated OR (as above) of 0.13 (95 % CI 0.08-0.22); and the OR (as above) for golimumab was 0.42 (95 % CI 0.22-0.81). All figures were statistically significant. ADABS decreased response by 27 % in RA and 18 % in SpA, both of which were statistically significant. However, the effect of ADABS on response was not statistically significant for IBD when we only included the studies that reported the duration of exposure in the regression analysis. The use of concomitant immunosuppressives (methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, and others) reduced the odds of ADAB formation in all patients by 74 %. The OR for risk with immunosuppressives versus without was 0.26 (95 % CI 0.21-0.32). CONCLUSION: ADABs developed in 13 % of patients. All five TNF inhibitors were associated with ADABs, but to varying degrees depending on the specific TNF inhibitor and the disease. ADABs are associated with reduced clinical response and an increased incidence of infusion reactions and injection site reactions. Concomitant use of immunosuppressives can reduce ADAB formation.			2015				8178
Comparative benefits and harms of second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapies in initial treatment of major depressive disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis		Amick, H. R., Gartlehner, G., Gaynes, B. N., Forneris, C., Asher, G. N., Morgan, L. C., Coker-Schwimmer, E., Boland, E., Lux, L. J., Gaylord, S., Bann, C., Pierl, C. B. and Lohr, K. N.				bmj (clinical research ed.)	bmj (clinical research ed.)	STUDY QUESTION: What are the benefits and harms of second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) in the initial treatment of a current episode of major depressive disorder in adults? METHODS: This was a systematic review including qualitative assessment and meta-analyses using random and fixed effects models. Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched from January1990 through January 2015. The 11 randomized controlled trials included compared a second generation antidepressant CBT. Ten trials compared antidepressant monotherapy with CBT alone; three compared antidepressant monotherapy with antidepressant plus CBT. SUMMARY ANSWER AND LIMITATIONS: Meta-analyses found no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between second generation antidepressants and CBT for response (risk ratio 0.91, 0.77 to 1.07), remission (0.98, 0.73 to 1.32), or change in 17 item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score (weighted mean difference, -0.38, -2.87 to 2.10). Similarly, no significant differences were found in rates of overall study discontinuation (risk ratio 0.90, 0.49 to 1.65) or discontinuation attributable to lack of efficacy (0.40, 0.05 to 2.91). Although more patients treated with a second generation antidepressant than receiving CBT withdrew from studies because of adverse events, the difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio 3.29, 0.42 to 25.72). No conclusions could be drawn about other outcomes because of lack of evidence. Results should be interpreted cautiously given the low strength of evidence for most outcomes. The scope of this review was limited to trials that enrolled adult patients with major depressive disorder and compared a second generation antidepressant with CBT, and many of the included trials had methodological shortcomings that may limit confidence in some of the findings. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Second generation antidepressants and CBT have evidence bases of benefits and harms in major depressive disorder. Available evidence suggests no difference in treatment effects of second generation antidepressants and CBT, either alone or in combination, although small numbers may preclude detection of small but clinically meaningful differences.Funding, competing interests, data sharing This project was funded under contract from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality by the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center.

Effectiveness of Educational Interventions to Increase Primary Care Follow-up for Adults Seen in the Emergency Department for Acute Asthma: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Villa-Roel, C., Nikel, T., Ospina, M., Voaklander, B., Campbell, S. and Rowe, B. H.				academic emergency medicine : official journal of the society for academic emergency medicine	academic emergency medicine : official journal of the society for academic emergency medicine	OBJECTIVES: Patients with asthma commonly present to emergency departments (ED) with exacerbations. Asthma guidelines recommend close follow-up with a primary care provider (PCP) after ED discharge; however, this linkage is often delayed or absent. The objective of this study was to assess whether ED-directed educational interventions improve office follow-up with PCPs after ED discharge for acute asthma. METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in seven electronic databases (1946 to 2014). Randomized controlled clinical trials examining the effectiveness of educational interventions to increase office follow-up with a PCP were included. Study quality was determined using the Cochrane risk of bias tool; fidelity of the interventions was assessed using the Treatment Fidelity Assessment Grid. Using study data, risk ratios (RRs),and the number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects models. RESULTS: From 427 potentially relevant studies, five (n = 825) were included. The overall risk of bias was unclear, and the description of intervention fidelity varied across the studies. Educational interventions targeting either patients or PCPs led to a greater likelihood of having primary care follow-up after ED discharge (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.31 to 1.87; I(2)  = 0%). The number needed to treat for benefit was six (95% CI = 4 to 11). No significant benefit was observed in reductions of relapses (RR = 1.3; 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.98; I(2)  = 23%) and admissions (RR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.24 to 1.06; I(2)  = 0%). Due to the small number of studies for each comparison, publication bias was not formally assessed. CONCLUSIONS: ED-directed educational interventions targeting either patients or providers increase the chance of having office follow-up visits with PCPs after asthma exacerbations. Their impact on health-related outcomes (e.g., relapse and admissions) remains unclear.			2016				10061
Managements of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation: A systematic review		de'Angelis, N., Landi, F., Carra, M. C. and Azoulay, D.				world journal of gastroenterology	world journal of gastroenterology	AIM: To investigate the efficacy (survival) and safety of treatments for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in liver transplantation (LT) patients. METHODS: Literature search was performed on available online databases without a time limit until January 2015. Clinical studies describing survival after HCC recurrence in LT patients were retrieved for a full-text evaluation. A total of 61 studies were selected: 13 case reports, 41 retrospective case series, and 7 retrospective comparative studies. RESULTS: Based on all included studies, the mean HCC recurrence rate was 16% of all LTs for HCC. A total of 1021 LT patients experienced HCC recurrence. The median time from LT to HCC recurrence was 13 mo (range 2-132 mo). The majority of patients (67%) presented with HCC extra-hepatic recurrences, involving lung, bone, adrenal gland, peritoneal lymph nodes, and rarely the brain. Overall survival after HCC recurrence was 12.97 mo. Surgical resection of localized HCC recurrence and Sorafenib for controlling systemic spread of HCC recurrence were associated with the higher survival rates (42 and 18 mo, respectively). However, Sorafenib, especially when combined with mTOR, was frequently associated with severe side effects that required dose reduction or discontinuation CONCLUSION: Management of recurrent HCC in LT patients is challenging and associated with poor prognosis independently of the type of treatment.			2015				8747
The Medical Treatment of New-Onset Peripartum Cardiomyopathy: A Systematic Review of Prospective Studies		Desplantie, O., Tremblay-Gravel, M., Avram, R., Marquis-Gravel, G., Ducharme, A., Jolicoeur, E. M. and Initiative Investigators, Bro-Hf				the canadian journal of cardiology	the canadian journal of cardiology	BACKGROUND: Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare disorder with potentially fatal consequences, which occurs mainly in previously healthy women. The aetiology of PPCM remains unknown and various pathologic mechanisms have been proposed, including immune-mediated injuries and impaired response to oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. Several therapies have been studied, but few have been validated in a well-designed randomized controlled trial. METHODS: In the present study we sought to review the medical treatment intended for acute PPCM. To this end, we performed a systematic review of the literature of randomized and nonrandomized prospective clinical studies. RESULTS: We identified 2 randomized controlled trials that evaluated the dopamine agonist bromocriptine and the inotrope levosimendan, respectively, and 1 nonrandomized study that evaluated the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline. We reviewed the pathophysiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties for each treatment option identified. Bromocriptine and pentoxifylline both improved left ventricular systolic function and patient-oriented clinical end points and levosimendan did not improve mortality or echocardiographic findings of PPCM. CONCLUSIONS: In this review we identified bromocriptine and pentoxifylline, but not levosimendan, as potentially useful agents to improve left ventricle function and outcomes in PPCM.			2015				5978
Controlling angiogenesis in gastric cancer: A systematic review of anti-angiogenic trials		Shan, F., Miao, R., Xue, K., Li, Z., Li, Z., Bu, Z., Wu, A., Zhang, L., Wu, X., Zong, X., Wang, X., Li, S., Ji, X., Jia, Z., Li, Z. and Ji, J.				cancer letters	cancer letters	PURPOSE: Angiogenesis is a promising therapeutic target to inhibit tumor growth. This review summarizes data from clinical trials of anti-angiogenic agents in gastric cancer. DESIGN: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase and conference databases is performed to identify clinical trials with specific anti-angiogenic agents in gastric cancer treatment RESULTS: The risk of disease progression (37-52%) and death (19-22%) with ramucirumab as second-line treatment decreases in phase III trials in advanced gastric cancer. No significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy is shown. Bevacizumab or ramucirumab combined with traditional chemotherapy is associated with higher adverse event rate compared to chemotherapy alone. Except for apatinib, phase II trials of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may improve overall response rate, but there are no significant improvements in OS and progression-free survival (PFS) when combined with chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Phase III trials in advanced gastric cancer have demonstrated improved outcome with ramucirumab as second-line treatment. Most of the other studies on anti-angiogenic agents in gastric cancer have reported improvement in response rate but not in OS compared to chemotherapy alone. Future research is expected in optimizing the anti-angiogenic therapy combined with traditional treatment.			2016				6728
Effects of low-dose and very low-dose dose ketamine among patients with major depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Xu, Y., Hackett, M., Carter, G., Loo, C., Gálvez, V., Glozier, N., Glue, P., Lapidus, K., McGirr, A., Somogyi, A. A., Mitchell, P. B. and Rodgers, A.				the international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / official scientific journal of the collegium internationale neuropsychopharmacologicum (cinp)	the international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / official scientific journal of the collegium internationale neuropsychopharmacologicum (cinp)	BACKGROUND: Several recent trials indicate low-dose ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects. However uncertainty remains in several areas: dose response, consistency across patient groups, effects on suicidality and possible biases arising from crossover trials. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for relevant randomized trials in Medline, Embase and PsycINFO databases up to August 2014. The primary endpoints were change in depression scale scores at days 1, 3 and 7, remission, response, suicidality, safety and tolerability. Data were abstracted independently by two reviewers. Where possible, unpublished data were obtained on treatment effects in the first period of crossover trials. RESULTS: Nine trials were identified, including 201 patients (52% female, mean age 46 years). Six trials assessed low dose ketamine (0.5 mg/kg intravenous) and three tested very low dose ketamine (one trial assessed 50 mg intra-nasal spray, another assessed 0.1-0.4 mg/kg intravenous and another assessed 0.1-0.5 mg/kg intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous). At day 3, the reduction in depression severity score was less marked in the very low dose trials (P homogeneity <0.05) and among bipolar patients. In analyses excluding the second period of crossover trials, response rates at day 7 were increased with ketamine (relative risk [RR] 3.4, 95% CI 1.6-7.1, p=0.001), as were remission rates (RR 2.6, CI 1.2-5.7, p=0.02). The absolute benefits were large, with day 7 remission rates of 24% vs 6% (p=0.02). Seven trials provided unpublished data on suicidality item scores, which were reduced on days 1 and 3 (both p<0.01) but not day 7. CONCLUSIONS: Low dose ketamine appears more effective than very low dose. There is substantial heterogeneity in clinical response, with remission among one-fifth of patients at one week but most others having benefits that are less durable. Larger, longer term parallel group trials are needed to determine if efficacy can be extended, and to further assess safety.			2016				9644
Dorsal anterior cingulotomy and anterior capsulotomy for severe, refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review of observational studies		Brown, L. T., Mikell, C. B., Youngerman, B. E., Zhang, Y., McKhann, G. M. and Sheth, S. A.				journal of neurosurgery	journal of neurosurgery	OBJECT The object of this study was to perform a systematic review, according to Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) guidelines, of the clinical efficacy and adverse effect profile of dorsal anterior cingulotomy compared with anterior capsulotomy for the treatment of severe, refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). METHODS The authors included studies comparing objective clinical measures before and after cingulotomy or capsulotomy (surgical and radiosurgical) in patients with OCD. Only papers reporting the most current follow-up data for each group of investigators were included. Studies reporting results on patients undergoing one or more procedures other than cingulotomy or capsulotomy were excluded. Case reports and studies with a mean follow-up shorter than 12 months were excluded. Clinical response was defined in terms of a change in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score. The authors searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge through October 2013. English and non-English articles and abstracts were reviewed. RESULTS Ten studies involving 193 participants evaluated the length of follow-up, change in the Y-BOCS score, and postoperative adverse events (AEs) after cingulotomy (n = 2 studies, n = 81 participants) or capsulotomy (n = 8 studies, n = 112 participants). The average time to the last follow-up was 47 months for cingulotomy and 60 months for capsulotomy. The mean reduction in the Y-BOCS score at 12 months' follow-up was 37% for cingulotomy and 55% for capsulotomy. At the last follow-up, the mean reduction in Y-BOCS score was 37% for cingulotomy and 57% for capsulotomy. The average full response rate to cingulotomy at the last follow-up was 41% (range 38%-47%, n = 2 studies, n = 51 participants), and to capsulotomy was 54% (range 37%-80%, n = 5 studies, n = 50 participants). The rate of transient AEs was 14.3% across cingulotomy studies (n = 116 procedures) and 56.2% across capsulotomy studies (n = 112 procedures). The rate of serious or permanent AEs was 5.2% across cingulotomy studies and 21.4% across capsulotomy studies. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review of the literature supports the efficacy of both dorsal anterior cingulotomy and anterior capsulotomy in this highly treatment-refractory population. The observational nature of available data limits the ability to directly compare these procedures. Controlled or head-to-head studies are necessary to identify differences in efficacy or AEs and may lead to the individualization of treatment recommendations.			2016				7293
Comparison of Direct Anterior and Lateral Approaches in Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)		Yue, C., Kang, P. and Pei, F.				medicine	medicine	The direct anterior approach (DAA) to total hip arthroplasty has been promoted as a minimally invasive alternative to the lateral approach, which we sought to verify by systematically reviewing and meta-analyzing the literature comparing clinical, radiographic, and surgical outcomes. Two reviewers independently searched PubMed, OVID, and Web of Science databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing the DAA and lateral approach for total hip arthroplasty. Quality of RCTs was assessed using the Jadad scoring system, quality of cohort studies, using the Minors system. Data were extracted and meta-analyzed or qualitatively synthesized for primary outcomes (function, complications, and hospitalization time) and several secondary outcomes. Data were extracted from 12 trials involving 4901 arthroplasty procedures. Meta-analysis showed that DAA was associated with significantly shorter hospitalization than the lateral approach, as well as greater functional rehabilitation and lower perceived pain during the early postoperative period. On the other hand, DAA was associated with longer surgery time. The 2 approaches were associated with similar rates of perioperative surgical complications and transfusions, as well as similar radiographic analysis results. Although DAA may provide shorter hospitalization and faster recovery during the early postoperative period, the available evidence is still insufficient to conclude whether the DAA or lateral approach is superior for total hip arthroplasty. More high-quality studies and subsequent meta-analyses are needed.			2015				9754
Exercise training for managing behavioral and psychological symptoms in people with dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis		de Souto Barreto, P., Demougeot, L., Pillard, F., Lapeyre-Mestre, M. and Rolland, Y.				ageing research reviews	ageing research reviews	This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessed the effects of exercise on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD, including depression) in people with dementia (PWD). Secondary outcomes for the effects of exercise were mortality and antipsychotic use. Twenty studies were included in this review (n=18 in the meta-analysis). Most studies used a multicomponent exercise training (n=13) as intervention; the control group was often a usual care (n=10) or a socially-active (n=8) group. Exercise did not reduce global levels of BPSD (n=4. Weighted mean difference -3.884; 95% CI -8.969-1.201; I(2)=69.4%). Exercise significantly reduced depression levels in PWD (n=7). Standardized mean difference -0.306; 95% CI -0.571 to -0.041; I(2)=46.8%); similar patterns were obtained in sensitivity analysis performed among studies with: institutionalized people (p=0.038), multicomponent training (p=0.056), social control group (p=0.08), and low risk of attrition bias (p=0.11). Exploratory analysis showed that the principal BPSD (other than depression) positively affected by exercise was aberrant motor behavior. Exercise had no effect on mortality. Data on antipsychotics were scarce. In conclusion, exercise reduces depression levels in PWD. Future studies should examine whether exercise reduces the use (and doses) of antipsychotics and other drugs often used to manage BPSD.			2015				7350
A Systematic Review of mHealth-Based Heart Failure Interventions		Cajita, M. I., Gleason, K. T. and Han, H. R.				the journal of cardiovascular nursing	the journal of cardiovascular nursing	BACKGROUND: The popularity of mobile phones and similar mobile devices makes it an ideal medium for delivering interventions. This is especially true with heart failure (HF) interventions, in which mHealth-based HF interventions are rapidly replacing their telephone-based predecessors. PURPOSE: This systematic review examined the impact of mHealth-based HF management interventions on HF outcomes. The specific aims of the systematic review are to (1) describe current mHealth-based HF interventions and (2) discuss the impact of these interventions on HF outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Scopus were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies that tested mHealth interventions in people with HF using the terms Heart Failure, Mobile Health, mHealth, Telemedicine, Text Messaging, Texting, Short Message Service, Mobile Applications, and Mobile Apps. CONCLUSIONS: Ten articles, representing 9 studies, were included in this review. The majority of the studies utilized mobile health technology as part of an HF monitoring system, which typically included a blood pressure-measuring device, weighing scale, and an electrocardiogram recorder. The impact of the mHealth interventions on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, HF-related hospitalizations, length of stay, New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular ejection fraction, quality of life, and self-care were inconsistent at best. IMPLICATIONS: Further research is needed to conclusively determine the impact of mHealth interventions on HF outcomes. The limitations of the current studies (eg, inadequate sample size, quasi-experimental design, use of older mobile phone models, etc) should be taken into account when designing future studies.			2016				5421
Impact of Collateral Status on Successful Revascularization in Endovascular Treatment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Leng, X., Fang, H., Leung, T. W., Mao, C., Xu, Y., Miao, Z., Liu, L., Wong, K. S. and Liebeskind, D. S.				cerebrovascular diseases (basel, switzerland)	cerebrovascular diseases (basel, switzerland)	BACKGROUND: Pre-treatment collateral status may be associated with the rates of successful revascularization in acute ischemic stroke patients receiving endovascular treatment (EVT). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize relevant evidence currently available. METHODS: Relevant full-text articles published in English since January 1, 2000, reporting associations between collateral status and successful reperfusion and/or recanalization in acute ischemic stroke patients receiving EVT in cohort or case-control studies, or randomized clinical trials, were retrieved through search of PubMed. Study selection, data extraction and study quality assessment were carried out by 2 investigators. Risk ratios (RR) were pooled for good vs. poor collaterals for the outcomes of successful reperfusion and recanalization, based on random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore for potential factors that might interfere with the effects of pre-treatment collateral status on reperfusion by EVT. RESULTS: In total, 27 studies (2,366 subjects) were included in qualitative analysis, among which 24 studies (2,239 subjects) were quantitatively analyzed. Overall, good pre-treatment collaterals significantly increased the rate of both successful reperfusion (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.17-1.40; p < 0.001) and recanalization (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.42; p = 0.006), as compared with poor collaterals. Subgroup analyses revealed that the effects of collateral status on successful reperfusion by EVT might be different between populations with different ethnicities. CONCLUSIONS: Good pre-treatment collaterals may enhance the rates of successful reperfusion and recanalization in EVT for acute ischemic stroke. This may partly explain the favorable effects of good pre-treatment collaterals on clinical outcomes of stroke patients receiving EVT. Thus, it would be valuable to assess the collateral status prior to EVT in acute ischemic stroke. But studies are needed to further verify if the positive effects of good collaterals on revascularization by EVT are restricted to certain subgroups of patients.			2016				6945
Effectiveness of Policies on Reducing Exposure to Ionizing Radiation From Medical Imaging: A Systematic Review		Thaker, A., Navadeh, S., Gonzales, H. and Malekinejad, M.				journal of the american college of radiology : jacr	journal of the american college of radiology : jacr	PURPOSE: The use of medical imaging has expanded greatly in the past three decades, raising concern about potential unwanted carcinogenic harms associated with exposure to ionizing radiation among patients. This study summarizes evidence of efficacy of interventions that have prompted policies, and structural-level interventions aimed at reducing radiation dose and risk of cancer, especially among women. METHODS: Using standard terms, we conducted searches in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science, and de-duplicated retrieved citations. We hand-searched the reference section of eligible studies and contacted radiology experts to identify studies missed from electronic searches. Two reviewers screened retrieved citations based on predefined eligibility criteria, to identify relevant studies, extract key information from each, rate the quality of evidence, and summarize data in tabular and graphical format. RESULTS: From a total of 1,543 unique citations identified from all sources, 16 were included for data extraction. Half of the studies focused on reduction of ionizing exposure from CT, and half on x-ray or fluoroscopy. Identified interventions were broadly categorized as: policy or structural intervention (two; 13%); multipronged (four; 25%); dose-feedback system (five; 31%); provision of training (four; 25%); and quality-control audit (one; 6%). In general, multipronged programs had a higher range for dose reduction (22%-74%), followed by policy/structural interventions (37%-50%). CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence on the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing patient radiation dose is disperse and low in quality. Compared with other approaches, multipronged efforts may offer more patient protection.			2015				8979
Effects of yoga exercises for headaches: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials		Kim, S. D.				journal of physical therapy science	journal of physical therapy science	[Purpose] To assess the evidence for the effectiveness of yoga exercises in the management of headaches. [Subjects and Methods] A search was conducted of six electronic databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the effects of yogic intervention on headaches published in any language before January 2015. Quality assessment was conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. [Results] One potential trial was identified and included in this review. The quality critical appraisal indicated a moderate risk of bias. The available data could only be included as a narrative description. Headache intensity and frequency, anxiety and depression scores, and symptomatic medication use were significantly lower in the yoga group compared to the control group. [Conclusion] There is evidence from one RCT that yoga exercises may be beneficial for headaches. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of RCTs. Therefore, further rigorous methodological and high quality RCTs are required to investigate the hypothesis that yoga exercises alleviate headaches, and to confirm and further comprehend the effects of standardized yoga programs on headaches.			2015				8756
Statin use and breast cancer survival and risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Wu, Q. J., Tu, C., Li, Y. Y., Zhu, J., Qian, K. Q., Li, W. J. and Wu, L.				oncotarget	oncotarget	The purpose of this study is to determine the associations between statin use and breast cancer survival and risk by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science up to August 2015 for identifying relevant prospective or case-control studies, or randomized clinical trials. Five prospective studies involving 60,911 patients reported the association between statin use and breast cancer mortality. Eleven prospective studies, 12 case-control studies and 9 randomized clinical trials involving 83,919 patients reported the association between statin use and breast cancer risk. After pooling estimates from all available studies, there was a significantly negative association between pre-diagnosis statin use and breast cancer mortality (for overall survival (OS): hazard ratio (HR) = 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.84; for disease specific survival (DSS): HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.99). There was also a significant inverse association between post-diagnosis statin use and breast cancer DSS (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-0.98), although the association with breast cancer OS did not reach statistical significance (HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.48-1.07). Additionally, there was a non-linear relationship for the duration of post-diagnosis statin use with breast cancer specific mortality. On the other hand, with regards to the relationship between statin use and breast cancer risk, no significant association was detected. Our analyses suggest that although statin use may not influence breast cancer risk, the use of statin may be associated with decrease mortality of breast cancer patients. Further large-scale studies are warranted to validate our findings.			2015				6951
Effects of Olive Oil on Markers of Inflammation and Endothelial Function-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Schwingshackl, L., Christoph, M. and Hoffmann, G.				nutrients	nutrients	The aim of the present systematic review was to synthesize data from randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of olive oil on markers of inflammation or endothelial function. Literature search in electronic databases Cochrane Trial Register, EMBASE, and MEDLINE was performed. Thirty studies enrolling 3106 participants fulfilled the selection criteria. Pooled effects of different interventions were assessed as mean difference using a random effects model. Olive oil interventions (with daily consumption ranging approximately between 1 mg and 50 mg) resulted in a significantly more pronounced decrease in C-reactive protein (mean difference: -0.64 mg/L, (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.96 to -0.31), p < 0.0001, n = 15 trials) and interleukin-6 (mean difference: -0.29 (95% CI -0.7 to -0.02), p < 0.04, n = 7 trials) as compared to controls, respectively. Values of flow-mediated dilatation (given as absolute percentage) were significantly more increased in individuals subjected to olive oil interventions (mean difference: 0.76% (95% CI 0.27 to 1.24), p < 0.002, n = 8 trials). These results provide evidence that olive oil might exert beneficial effects on endothelial function as well as markers of inflammation and endothelial function, thus representing a key ingredient contributing to the cardiovascular-protective effects of a Mediterranean diet. However, due to the heterogeneous study designs (e.g., olive oil given as a supplement or as part of dietary pattern, variations in control diets), a conservative interpretation of the results is necessary.			2015				6704
Comparative efficacy of anti-diabetic agents on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and non-randomized studies		Tang, W., Xu, Q., Hong, T., Tong, G., Feng, W., Shen, S., Bi, Y. and Zhu, D.				diabetes/metabolism research and reviews	diabetes/metabolism research and reviews	BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a high prevalence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, we sought to provide a comprehensive assessment regarding the effects of anti-diabetic agents on NAFLD in patients with T2DM. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with different anti-diabetic agents in T2DM. Observational trials were also recruited to expand our population. Hepatic fat content and liver histology were evaluated as primary outcomes. Pooled estimates were calculated using a fixed effect model. RESULTS: One thousand one hundred ninety-six participants in 19 RCTs and 14 non-randomized studies were included. Evidence from RCTs and observational studies suggested that greater hepatic fat content reduction and improved liver histology were seen in thiazolidinediones for 12-72 weeks; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists had beneficial effects on hepatic fat content after 26-50 weeks intervention, and insulin/metformin combination with 3-7 months improved hepatic fat content. Initiating metformin or dapagliflozin showed no benefit on hepatic fat content or liver histology in 16-48 weeks. Besides, nateglinide for 18 months was reported in a small sample-size RCT to improve hepatic fat content and liver histology. Sitagliptin therapy of 1 year also provided benefit on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis score in an observational study. CONCLUSIONS: For T2DM with NAFLD, administrating thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists seems to provide more identified advances in attenuating hepatic fat content. Further RCTs are warranted to assess the efficacy of various hypoglycemic agents on clinical outcomes associated with NAFLD in T2DM. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.			2016				10050
Traditional herbal medicine as adjunctive therapy for breast cancer: A systematic review		Kim, W., Lee, W. B., Lee, J. W., Min, B. I., Baek, S. K., Lee, H. S. and Cho, S. H.				complementary therapies in medicine	complementary therapies in medicine	OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of traditional herbal medicine (THM) as adjunctive therapy for breast cancer as evidenced by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Five electronic English and Chinese databases were systematically searched up to February, 2014. All RCTs involving THM in combination with conventional cancer therapy for breast cancer were included. RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 798 breast cancer patients were systematically reviewed. Three studies reported a significant difference in the improvement of quality of life (QOL) compared to the control group. Two studies reported an increase in the white blood cell count after treatment. Data on hot flashes and sleep quality were evaluated. However, no significant differences in immediate tumor response were observed. CONCLUSION: THM combined with conventional therapy in the treatment of breast cancer is efficacious in improving QOL and in decreasing the number of hot flashes per day. More research and well-designed, rigorous, large clinical trials are necessary to further address these issues.			2015				8980
Is the Era of intravenous proton pump inhibitors coming to an end in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers? meta-analysis of the published literature		Jian, Z., Li, H., Race, N. S., Ma, T., Jin, H. and Yin, Z.				british journal of clinical pharmacology	british journal of clinical pharmacology	AIM: Both oral and intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are equipotent in raising gastric pH, however, whether oral PPI can replace intravenous PPI in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare oral and intravenous PPIs among patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. A search for all major databases and relevant journals from inception to April 2015 without restriction on languages was performed. RESULTS: A total of 859 patients from seven randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. Similar pooled outcome was demonstrated in terms of oral PPI versus intravenous PPI in the rate of recurrent bleeding within a 30-day of follow-up period (risk ratio?=?0.90; 95%CI: 0.58, 1.39; P?=?0.62; I(2) ?=?0%). In terms of the rate of mortality, both oral and intravenous PPIs showed similar outcomes, and the pooled risk ratio was 0.88 (95%CI: 0.29, 2.71; P?=?0.82; I(2) ?=?0%). Likewise, no significant difference was detected in blood transfusion and hospital stay, and the pooled mean differences were -0.14 (95%CI: -0.39, 0.12; P?=?0.29; I(2) ?=?32%) and -0.60 (95%CI: -1.42, 0.23; P?=?0.16; I(2) ?=?79%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the effectiveness of oral PPI is a feasible, safe alternative to intravenous PPI in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. Oral PPI may be able to replace intravenous PPI as the treatment of choice in peptic ulcer bleeding. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.			2016				10914
Surgical Treatment Strategies for High-Grade Spondylolisthesis: A Systematic Review		Passias, P. G., Poorman, C. E., Yang, S., Boniello, A. J., Jalai, C. M., Worley, N. and Lafage, V.				international journal of spine surgery	international journal of spine surgery	BACKGROUND: HGS is a severe deformity most commonly affecting L5-S1 vertebral segment. Treatment available for HGS includes a range of different surgical options: full or partial reduction of translation and/or abnormal alignment and in situ fusion with or without decompression. Various instrumented or non-instrumented constructs are available, and surgical approach varies from anterior/posterior to combined depending on surgeon preference and experience. The aim of this systematic review was to review the literature on lumbosacral high-grade spondylolisthesis (HGS), identify patients at risk for progression to higher-grade slip and evaluate various surgical strategies to report on complications and radiographic and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane and Google Scholar for papers relevant to HGS was performed. 19 articles were included after title, abstract, and full-text review and grouped to analyze baseline radiographic parameters and the effect of surgical approach, instrumentation, reduction and decompression on patient radiographic and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: There is a lack of high-quality studies pertaining to surgical treatment for HGS, and a majority of included papers were Level III or IV based on the JBJS Levels of Evidence Criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment for HGS can vary depending on patient age. There is strong evidence of an association between increased pelvic incidence (PI) and presence of HGS and moderately strong evidence that patients with unbalanced pelvis can benefit from correction of lumbopelvic parameters with partial reduction. Surgeons need to weigh the benefits of fixing the deformity with the risks of potential complications, assessing patient satisfaction as well as their understanding of the possible complications. However, further research is necessary to make more definitive conclusions on surgical treatment guidelines for HGS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.			2015				5473
A systematic review of medicinal plants used for weight loss in Brazil: Is there potential for obesity treatment?		Cercato, L. M., White, P. A., Nampo, F. K., Santos, M. R. and Camargo, E. A.				journal of ethnopharmacology	journal of ethnopharmacology	ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Obesity is a pandemic disease and its prevalence is still increasing. Moreover, it has important costs to public health. In Brazil, many plants are used for weight loss by overweight or obese people, but there is a lack of scientific basis for this practice. Many ethnobotanical studies aiming to characterize this usage have been published, but they are still limited by the region considered and the diversity of the popular knowledge. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was undertaken to systematically review the ethnobotanical surveys regarding the species utilized to reduce body weight in overweight or obese people in Brazil. METHODS: Ethnobotanical surveys related to this usage and performed in Brazilian regions were systematically found in MEDLINE, LILACS and Scopus. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were included in this review. Forty-eight species were popularly utilized to lose weight. The most cited species were Baccharis trimera (Less.) DC, Annona muricata L. and Hancornia speciosa Gomes. Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze and Hibiscus sabdariffa L. were also cited and are supported by either animal or human investigations that indicate some beneficial activity against obesity. However, for the majority of species cited in the included studies, there is no scientific basis that assures the biological effects of this usage. Many studies have demonstrated important effects of these plants on glycemia, serum lipid levels or body weight control in non-obese conditions, which is not sufficient to recommend the use of these plants to reduce body weight in overweight or obese people. CONCLUSIONS: Although many plants are popularly used to reduce weight in overweight or obese people in Brazil, there is little scientific evidence corroborating its usage. Based on the ethnobotanical data presented, this review indicates the plants that should be considered for scientifically controlled studies devoted to investigating their effects on obesity.			2015				9814
Observation versus prophylactic Ladd procedure for asymptomatic intestinal rotational abnormalities in heterotaxy syndrome: A systematic review		Landisch, R., Abdel-Hafeez, A. H., Massoumi, R., Christensen, M., Shillingford, A. and Wagner, A. J.				journal of pediatric surgery	journal of pediatric surgery	BACKGROUND: The management of intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRA) in heterotaxy syndrome (HS) remains inconsistent. Because of the high incidence of malrotation in HS, screening of asymptomatic patients is standard of care in some institutions. The Ladd procedure is the treatment for malrotation, and has been reported to have high complication rates in HS patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of publications describing IRA in pediatric HS patients from January 1993 to present. The incidence of volvulus on surgical exploration was determined. Perioperative and long-term outcomes were analyzed to determine complication and mortality rates. RESULTS: Eleven retrospective studies describing 649 HS patients were identified. Of all patients with HS, 27% (176/649) underwent Ladd procedure. Only 1.2% (8/649) of HS patients included had volvulus. Postoperative complications occurred in 25 patients (14%), including a 10% incidence of small bowel obstruction. Perioperative and overall mortality rates after Ladd procedure were 3% and 21%, respectively. Six studies described mesenteric width, reporting 43% to have narrow mesentery. CONCLUSION: The Ladd procedure is not without significant morbidity and mortality in heterotaxy patients. Further prospective studies should investigate predictors of mesenteric width to spare the unnecessary morbidity of surgery in patients who are at low risk for volvulus.			2015				6611
Procedural instruction in invasive bedside procedures: a systematic review and meta-analysis of effective teaching approaches		Huang, G. C., McSparron, J. I., Balk, E. M., Richards, J. B., Smith, C. C., Whelan, J. S., Newman, L. R. and Smetana, G. W.				bmj quality & safety	bmj quality & safety	IMPORTANCE: Optimal approaches to teaching bedside procedures are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify effective instructional approaches in procedural training. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library through December 2014. STUDY SELECTION: We included research articles that addressed procedural training among physicians or physician trainees for 12 bedside procedures. Two independent reviewers screened 9312 citations and identified 344 articles for full-text review. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data from full-text articles. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We included measurements as classified by translational science outcomes T1 (testing settings), T2 (patient care practices) and T3 (patient/public health outcomes). Due to incomplete reporting, we post hoc classified study outcomes as 'negative' or 'positive' based on statistical significance. We performed meta-analyses of outcomes on the subset of studies sharing similar outcomes. RESULTS: We found 161 eligible studies (44 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 34 non-RCTs and 83 uncontrolled trials). Simulation was the most frequently published educational mode (78%). Our post hoc classification showed that studies involving simulation, competency-based approaches and RCTs had higher frequencies of T2/T3 outcomes. Meta-analyses showed that simulation (risk ratio (RR) 1.54 vs 0.55 for studies with vs without simulation, p=0.013) and competency-based approaches (RR 3.17 vs 0.89, p<0.001) were effective forms of training. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review of bedside procedural skills demonstrates that the current literature is heterogeneous and of varying quality and rigour. Evidence is strongest for the use of simulation and competency-based paradigms in teaching procedures, and these approaches should be the mainstay of programmes that train physicians to perform procedures. Further research should clarify differences among instructional methods (eg, forms of hands-on training) rather than among educational modes (eg, lecture vs simulation).			2016				6460
Fluoride-Releasing Materials to Prevent White Spot Lesions around Orthodontic Brackets: A Systematic Review		Nascimento, P. L., Fernandes, M. T., Figueiredo, F. E. and Faria, E. Silva A. L.				brazilian dental journal	brazilian dental journal	The relation between orthodontic fixed appliances use and enamel demineralization is well established. Different preventive approaches have been suggested to this problem, but controversy remains about which is the best. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of clinical trials that investigated the effectiveness of materials containing fluorides to lute brackets or cover the bonding interface in order to inhibit the development and progression of white spot lesions. The null hypothesis was that fluoride materials do not affect the incidence of white spot lesions around brackets. A MEDLINE search was conducted for randomized clinical trials evaluating the development of white spot lesions in patients using fixed orthodontic appliances, followed by meta-analysis comparing the results for patients for whom dental materials containing fluorides were used (experimental group) to those for whom these materials were not used (control group). The pooled relative risk of developing white spot lesions for the experimental group was 0.42 (95% confidence interval: 0.25 to 0.72); hence, when fluoride-releasing materials are used, the patient has 58% less risk of white spot lesion development. Regarding white spot lesion extent, the pooled mean difference between the experimental and control groups was not statistically significant (-0.12; 95% confidence interval: -0.29 to 0.04). In conclusion, the results of the present systematic review suggest that fluoride-releasing materials can reduce the risk of white spot lesions around brackets. However, when white spot lesions had already occurred, there is no evidence that fluoride-releasing materials reduce the extent of these lesions.			2016				5880
The efficacy and safety of nivolumab in the treatment of advanced melanoma: a meta-analysis of clinical trials		Jin, C., Zhang, X., Zhao, K., Xu, J., Zhao, M. and Xu, X.				oncotargets and therapy	oncotargets and therapy	"BACKGROUND: Nivolumab has become a therapeutic regimen for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma. The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS: A systematic search from January 2008 to August 2015 with ""nivolumab"" and ""advanced melanoma"" as search terms was performed for possible clinical trials. According to the hazard ratio and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for progression-free survival (PFS), rates of objective response, complete response, partial response, rates of toxic effects, and the efficacy and safety of nivolumab were assessed. Using the software Review Manager (version 5.3) a meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: There were four trials with 1,910 patients included. Based on the four trials, the pooled hazard ratio of PFS was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.43-0.66; P<0.001). The pooled risk ratio for the objective response rate, complete response, and partial response was 2.98% (95% CI, 2.38%-3.73%; P<0.001), 3.71% (95% CI, 2.67%-5.14%; P<0.001), and 2.51% (95% CI, 2.12%-2.99%; P<0.001), respectively. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab therapy significantly increased the risk of grade 3/4 rash and fatigue. CONCLUSION: Nivolumab-based therapy prolonged PFS in treatment of advanced melanoma, with less adverse effects. Nivolumab appears to be a favorable treatment option as a novel, targeted anticancer agent, for patients with advanced melanoma."			2016				10636
Endoscopic submucosal dissection of gastric subepithelial tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Bang, C. S., Baik, G. H., Shin, I. S., Suk, K. T., Yoon, J. H. and Kim, D. J.				the korean journal of internal medicine	the korean journal of internal medicine	BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the therapeutic outcomes of the endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) technique for the treatment of gastric subepithelial tumors (SETs). METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using the core databases. Data on the complete resection rates and the procedure-related perforation rates were extracted and analyzed. A random effects model was then applied for this meta-analysis. RESULTS: In all, 288 patients with 290 SETs were enrolled from nine studies (44 SETs originated from the submucosal layer; 246 SETs originated from the muscularis propria layer). The mean diameter of the lesions ranged from 17.99 to 38 mm. Overall, the pooled complete resection rate was estimated to be 86.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.9 to 91.3). If the analysis was limited to the lesions that originated from the submucosal layer, the pooled complete resection rate was 91.4% (95% CI, 77.9 to 97). If the analysis was limited to the lesions that originated from the muscularis propria, the pooled complete resection rate was 84.4% (95% CI, 78.7 to 88.8). The pooled procedure-related gastric perforation rate was 13% (95% CI, 9.4 to 17.6). Sensitivity analyses showed consistent results. Finally, publication bias was not detected. CONCLUSIONS: ESD, including endoscopic muscularis dissection, is a technically feasible procedure for the treatment of SETs. However, selection bias is suspected from the enrolled studies. For the development of a proper indication of ESD for SETs, further studies are needed.			2016				6537
Clinical outcomes of HIV care delivery models in the US: a systematic review		Kimmel, A. D., Martin, E. G., Galadima, H., Bono, R. S., Tehrani, A. B., Cyrus, J. W., Henderson, M., Freedberg, K. A. and Krist, A. H.				aids care	aids care	With over 1 million people living with HIV, the US faces national challenges in HIV care delivery due to an inadequate HIV specialist workforce and the increasing role of non-communicable chronic diseases in driving morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. Alternative HIV care delivery models, which include substantial roles for advanced practitioners and/or coordination between specialty and primary care settings in managing HIV-infected patients, may address these needs. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on patient-level HIV-specific and primary care health outcomes for HIV-infected adults receiving outpatient care across HIV care delivery models. We identified randomized trials and observational studies from bibliographic and other databases through March 2016. Eligible studies met pre-specified eligibility criteria including on care delivery models and patient-level health outcomes. We considered all available evidence, including non-experimental studies, and evaluated studies for risk of bias. We identified 3605 studies, of which 13 met eligibility criteria. Of the 13 eligible studies, the majority evaluated specialty-based care (9 studies). Across all studies and care delivery models, eligible studies primarily reported mortality and antiretroviral use, with specialty-based care associated with mortality reductions at the clinician and practice levels and with increased antiretroviral initiation or use at the clinician level but not the practice level. Limited and heterogeneous outcomes were reported for other patient-level HIV-specific outcomes (e.g., viral suppression) as well as for primary care health outcomes across all care delivery models. No studies addressed chronic care outcomes related to aging. Limited evidence was available across geographic settings and key populations. As re-design of care delivery in the US continues to evolve, better understanding of patient-level HIV-related and primary care health outcomes, especially across different staffing models and among different patient populations and geographic locations, is urgently needed to improve HIV disease management.			2016				9304
Safety and Efficacy of Different Catheter Ablations for Atrial Fibrillation: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Liu, X. H., Chen, C. F., Gao, X. F. and Xu, Y. Z.				pacing and clinical electrophysiology : pace	pacing and clinical electrophysiology : pace	BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested that cryoballoon ablation had clinical benefits comparable to those of radiofrequency ablation. However, recently, some new catheters have been invented, and no universal consensus exists on which ablation is the optimal choice. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess and compare the safety and efficacy of cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation by synthesizing published trials. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic literature review was conducted searching Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and so forth. All trials comparing cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation were screened and included if inclusion criteria were met. A total of 40 eligible studies were identified, adding up to 11,395 patients. The follow-up period ranged from 3 to 25 months. Overall analyses indicated that cryoballoon ablation could bring more benefit in procedural time (RR = -0.39, 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.15;), atrial fibrillation (AF) recrudescence(RR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.96), and major complications (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.58-0.95) for patients with AF. For the subgroups, the first-generation cryoballoon significantly reduced procedural time and major complications, but it increased ablation time. The patients referred for the second-generation cryoballoon (CBA) seemed to receive more clinical benefit (procedural time, fluoroscopic time, ablation time, AF recrudescence) and fewer complications. Finally, multiparty catheter (MTCA) was found to significantly reduce procedural and fluoroscopic times with a high rate of AF recrudescence. CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that cryoballoon ablation was associated with greater freedom from AF, shorter procedural time, and lower rate of major complications, compared with radiofrequency ablation. Especially, CBA was more advantageous. However, MTCA seems promising for radiofrequency ablation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.			2016				5810
The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of abatacept, adalimumab, etanercept and tocilizumab for treating juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a systematic review and economic evaluation		Shepherd, J., Cooper, K., Harris, P., Picot, J. and Rose, M.				health technology assessment (winchester, england)	health technology assessment (winchester, england)	BACKGROUND: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is characterised by joint pain, swelling and a limitation of movement caused by inflammation. Subsequent joint damage can lead to disability and growth restriction. Treatment commonly includes disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate. Clinical practice now favours newer drugs termed biologic DMARDs where indicated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of four biologic DMARDs [etanercept (Enbrel(®), Pfizer), abatacept (Orencia(®), Bristol-Myers Squibb), adalimumab (Humira(®), AbbVie) and tocilizumab (RoActemra(®), Roche) - with or without methotrexate where indicated] for the treatment of JIA (systemic or oligoarticular JIA are excluded). DATA SOURCES: Electronic bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were searched for published studies from inception to May 2015 for English-language articles. Bibliographies of related papers, systematic reviews and company submissions were screened and experts were contacted to identify additional evidence. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness were undertaken in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. A cost-utility decision-analytic model was developed to compare the estimated cost-effectiveness of biologic DMARDs versus methotrexate. The base-case time horizon was 30 years and the model took a NHS perspective, with costs and benefits discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: Four placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria for the clinical effectiveness review (one RCT evaluating each biologic DMARD). Only one RCT included UK participants. Participants had to achieve an American College of Rheumatology Pediatric (ACR Pedi)-30 response to open-label lead-in treatment in order to be randomised. An exploratory adjusted indirect comparison suggests that the four biologic DMARDs are similar, with fewer disease flares and greater proportions of ACR Pedi-50 and -70 responses among participants randomised to continued biologic DMARDs. However, confidence intervals were wide, the number of trials was low and there was clinical heterogeneity between trials. Open-label extensions of the trials showed that, generally, ACR responses remained constant or even increased after the double-blind phase. The proportions of adverse events and serious adverse events were generally similar between the treatment and placebo groups. Four economic evaluations of biologic DMARDs for patients with JIA were identified but all had limitations. Two quality-of-life studies were included, one of which informed the cost-utility model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for adalimumab, etanercept and tocilizumab versus methotrexate were £38,127, £32,526 and £38,656 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. The ICER for abatacept versus methotrexate as a second-line biologic was £39,536 per QALY. LIMITATIONS: The model does not incorporate the natural history of JIA in terms of long-term disease progression, as the current evidence is limited. There are no head-to-head trials of biologic DMARDs, and clinical evidence for specific JIA subtypes is limited. CONCLUSIONS: Biologic DMARDs are superior to placebo (with methotrexate where permitted) in children with (predominantly) polyarticular course JIA who have had an insufficient response to previous treatment. Randomised comparisons of biologic DMARDs with long-term efficacy and safety follow-up are needed to establish comparative effectiveness. RCTs for JIA subtypes for which evidence is lacking are also required. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42015016459.

Meta-analysis of negative-pressure wound therapy for closed surgical incisions		Hyldig, N., Birke-Sorensen, H., Kruse, M., Vinter, C., Joergensen, J. S., Sorensen, J. A., Mogensen, O., Lamont, R. F. and Bille, C.				the british journal of surgery	the british journal of surgery	BACKGROUND: Postoperative wound complications are common following surgical procedures. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is well recognized for the management of open wounds and has been applied recently to closed surgical incisions. The evidence base to support this intervention is limited. The aim of this study was to assess whether NPWT reduces postoperative wound complications when applied to closed surgical incisions. METHODS: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of NPWT compared with standard postoperative dressings on closed surgical incisions. RESULTS: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 1311 incisions in 1089 patients. NPWT was associated with a significant reduction in wound infection (relative risk (RR) 0·54, 95 per cent c.i. 0·33 to 0·89) and seroma formation (RR 0·48, 0·27 to 0·84) compared with standard care. The reduction in wound dehiscence was not significant. The numbers needed to treat were three (seroma), 17 (dehiscence) and 25 (infection). Methodological heterogeneity across studies led to downgrading of the quality of evidence to moderate for infection and seroma, and low for dehiscence. CONCLUSION: Compared with standard postoperative dressings, NPWT significantly reduced the rate of wound infection and seroma when applied to closed surgical wounds. Heterogeneity between the included studies means that no general recommendations can be made yet.			2016				10786
Care-Delivery Interventions to Manage Agitation and Aggression in Dementia Nursing Home and Assisted Living Residents: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Jutkowitz, E., Brasure, M., Fuchs, E., Shippee, T., Kane, R. A., Fink, H. A., Butler, M., Sylvanus, T. and Kane, R. L.				journal of the american geriatrics society	journal of the american geriatrics society	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions (staff training, care-delivery models, changes to the environment) to reduce and manage agitation and aggression in nursing home and assisted living residents. DESIGN: Three bibliographic databases, references of systematic reviews, ClincalTrials.gov, and the International Controlled Trials Registry Platform were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials reporting behavioral outcomes for nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Five investigators independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, rated risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence. Inclusion was limited to studies with low to moderate risk of bias. SETTING: Nursing homes and assisted living facilities. PARTICIPANTS: Facility caregiving staff. MEASUREMENTS: Agitation, aggression, antipsychotic and other psychotropic use, general behavior. RESULTS: Nineteen unique studies met entry criteria, addressing several categories of facility caregiver training interventions: dementia care mapping (DCM; n = 3), person-centered care (PCC; n = 3), clinical protocols to reduce the use of antipsychotic and other psychotropic drugs (n = 3), and emotion-oriented care (n = 2). Eleven additional studies evaluated other unique interventions. Results were pooled for the effect of each type of intervention on agitation and aggression: DCM (standardized mean difference -0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.66 to 0.42), PCC (standardized mean difference -0.15, 95% CI = -0.67 to 0.38), and protocols to reduce antipsychotic and other psychotropic use (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory mean difference -4.5, 95% C = -38.84 to 29.93). Strength of evidence was generally insufficient to draw conclusions regarding efficacy or comparative effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Evidence was insufficient regarding the efficacy of nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions to reduce agitation or aggression in nursing home and assisted living facility residents with dementia.			2016				9642
Role of Internal Mammary Node Radiation as a Part of Modern Breast Cancer Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review		Verma, V., Vicini, F., Tendulkar, R. D., Khan, A. J., Wobb, J., Edwards-Bennett, S., Desai, A. and Shah, C.				international journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics	international journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics	PURPOSE: Despite data from multiple randomized trials, the role of internal mammary lymph node irradiation as a part of regional nodal irradiation (IMLN RT-RNI) remains unanswered. Recent noteworthy data and modern RT techniques might identify a subset of patients who will benefit from IMLN RT-RNI, lending insight into the balance between improved outcomes and acceptable toxicity. We evaluated the current role of IMLN RT-RNI by analyzing randomized, prospective, and retrospective data. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a review of the published data was performed using PubMed to evaluate published studies from 1994 to 2015. The information evaluated included the number of patients, follow-up period, technical aspects of RT, and outcomes (clinical outcomes, complications/toxicity). RESULTS: We included 16 studies (4 randomized, 4 nonrandomized, 7 retrospective, and 1 meta-analysis). Although older randomized trials failed to show differences in clinical outcomes or toxicity with IMLN RT-RNI, recent randomized data suggest the potential for improved outcomes, including overall survival, with IMLN RT-RNI. Furthermore, nonrandomized data have suggested a potential benefit for central tumors with IMLN RT-RNI. Although recent data have suggested a potential increase in pulmonary complications with IMLN RT-RNI with the use of advanced radiation techniques, toxicity rates remain low with limited cardiac toxicity data available. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing data from recent randomized trials support the use of IMLN RT-RNI. IMLN RT can be considered based on the inclusion of IMLN RT as a part of RNI in recent trials and the inclusion criteria from IMLN RT-RNI trials and for patients with central or medial tumors and axillary disease.			2016				7771
Bridging external fixation versus non-bridging external fixation for unstable distal radius fractures: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Gu, W. L., Wang, J., Li, D. Q., Gong, M. Z., Chen, P., Li, Z. Y., Yang, L. F., Liu, W. and Zhou, Y.				journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the japanese orthopaedic association	journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the japanese orthopaedic association	OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare the relative effectiveness of bridging external fixation and non-bridging external fixation for distal radius fractures treatment. METHOD: Relevant literature were comprehensively searched using the PubMed, Springer Link, Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases without any language restrictions. STATA Version 12.0 software and Comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.0 were applied. RESULTS: A total of 905 patients with distal radius fracture from six eligible cohort studies were selected for statistical analysis. Our meta-analysis results indicate that the non-bridging cases had a higher risk of pin track infection, rupture of the extensor pollicis longus and nerve injury than the bridging cases. Subgroup analysis stratified by country indicated non-bridging patients showed evidence of an increased risk of pin track infection and higher risk of rupture of the extensor pollicis longus compared with the patients treated with bridging external fixation in the UK population. The follow-up results showed flexion degree of patients treated with non-bridging external fixation was slightly better than that of patients treated with bridging external fixation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is evidence in our systematic review and meta-analysis to support that bridging external fixation can reduce the incidence of pin tract infections and nerve injury compared to non-bridging external fixation, but have no significant difference in other complications and the recovery of wrist joint function. Bridging external fixation could therefore be a better choice in patients with distal radius fractures.			2016				6849
Radial Artery Occlusion After Transradial Interventions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Rashid, M., Kwok, C. S., Pancholy, S., Chugh, S., Kedev, S. A., Bernat, I., Ratib, K., Large, A., Fraser, D., Nolan, J. and Mamas, M. A.				journal of the american heart association	journal of the american heart association	BACKGROUND: Radial artery occlusion (RAO) may occur posttransradial intervention and limits the radial artery as a future access site, thus precluding its use as an arterial conduit. In this study, we investigate the incidence and factors influencing the RAO in the current literature. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies of RAO in transradial access. Relevant studies were identified and data were extracted. Data were synthesized by meta-analysis, quantitative pooling, graphical representation, or by narrative synthesis. A total of 66 studies with 31 345 participants were included in the analysis. Incident RAO ranged between <1% and 33% and varied with timing of assessment of radial artery patency (incidence of RAO within 24 hours was 7.7%, which decreased to 5.5% at >1 week follow-up). The most efficacious measure in reducing RAO was higher dose of heparin, because lower doses of heparin were associated with increased RAO (risk ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.17-0.76), whereas shorter compression times also reduced RAO (risk ratio 0.28, 95% CI 0.05-1.50). Several factors were found to be associated with RAO including age, sex, sheath size, and diameter of radial artery, but these factors were not consistent across all studies. CONCLUSIONS: RAO is a common complication of transradial access. Maintenance of radial patency should be an integral part of all procedures undertaken through the radial approach. High-dose heparin along with shorter compression times and patent hemostasis is recommended in reducing RAO.			2016				9110
A systematic review of plant-derived natural compounds for anxiety disorders		Farzaei, M. H., Bahramsoltani, R., Rahimi, R., Abbasabadi, F. and Abdollahi, M.				current topics in medicinal chemistry	current topics in medicinal chemistry	Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses affecting human beings. They range from panic to generalized anxiety disorders upsetting the well-being and psychosocial performance of patients. Several conventional anxiolytic drugs are being used which in turn result in several adverse effects. Therefore, studies to find suitable safe medicines from natural sources are being conducted by researchers. The aim of the present study is to comprehensively review phytochemical compounds with well-established anxiolytic activities and their structure-activity relationships as well as neuropsychopharmacological aspects. Results showed that phytochemicals like; alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans, cinnamates, terpenes and saponins possess anxiolytic effects in a wide range of animal models of anxiety. The involved mechanisms include interaction with ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors at benzodiazepine (BZD) and non-BZD sites with various affinity to different subunits, serotonergic 5-hydrodytryptamine (5-HT)1A and 5-HT2A/C receptors, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems, glycine and glutamate receptors, and ?-opioid receptor as well as cannabinoid (CB)1 and CB2 receptors. Phytochemicals also modulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-1? and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, and improve brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V (TRPV)3, nitric oxide cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway and monoamine oxidase enzymes are other targets of phytochemicals with anxiolytic activity. Taking together, these phytochemicals may be considered as supplements to conventional anxiolytic therapies in order to improve efficacy and reduce adverse effects. Further preclinical and clinical studies are still needed in order to recognize the structure-activity relationships, metabolism, absorption, and neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms of plant-derived natural agents.			2016				8310
Efficacy of Platelet-Rich Plasma versus Hyaluronic Acid for treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Sadabad, H. N., Behzadifar, M., Arasteh, F., Behzadifar, M. and Dehghan, H. R.				electronic physician	electronic physician	INTRODUCTION: Knee osteoarthritis is a very common chronic degenerative disease that could impose significant costs to the health system. Although osteoarthritis can affect all joints, knee osteoarthritis is the most common type among adolescents. Non-surgical treatments include corticosteroids injection, hyaluronic acid, and platelet-rich plasma. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of platelet-rich plasma versus hyaluronic acid for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: Pubmed, Cochran library, Scopus and Ovid databases were investigated to identify related studies from 2000 through August 2015. To study the efficiency, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) outcome using the Standard Mean Difference (SMD) index was calculated using a random model and a confidence interval of 95%. In addition, sensitivity and cumulative analysis were conducted. The data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3.5 and Stata 12 software. RESULTS: Seven studies with 722 subjects (364 participants in PRP and 358 participants in the HA group) were analyzed. The WOMAC PRP compared to HA, SMD = -0.75 (95% CI: -1.33 to -0.18, I2 = 92.6%) in treatment of knee osteoarthritis was statistically significant and PRP was more effective. CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis two years after PRP injection showed the efficacy of PRP versus HA. However, further studies are required to determine the longer-term effects.			2016				9540
The impact of frailty on postoperative outcomes in individuals aged 65 and over undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer: A systematic review		Fagard, K., Leonard, S., Deschodt, M., Devriendt, E., Wolthuis, A., Prenen, H., Flamaing, J., Milisen, K., Wildiers, H. and Kenis, C.				journal of geriatric oncology	journal of geriatric oncology	Colorectal cancer surgery is frequently performed in the older population. Many older persons have less physiological reserves and are thus more susceptible to adverse postoperative outcomes. Therefore, it seems important to distinguish the fit patients from the more vulnerable or frail. The aim of this review is to examine the evidence regarding the impact of frailty on postoperative outcomes in older patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. A systematic literature search of Medline Ovid was performed focusing on studies that examined the impact of frailty on postoperative outcomes after colorectal surgery in older people aged ?65years. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the MINORS quality assessment. Five articles, involving four studies and 486 participants in total, were included. Regardless of varying definitions of frailty and postoperative outcomes, the frail patients had less favourable outcomes in all of the studies. Compared to the non-frail group, the frail group had a higher risk of developing moderate to severe postoperative complications, had longer hospital stays, higher readmission rates, and decreased long-term survival rates. The results of this systematic review suggest the importance of assessing frailty in older persons scheduled for colorectal surgery because frailty is associated with a greater risk of postoperative adverse outcomes. We conclude that, although there is no consensus on the definition of frailty, assessing frailty in colorectal oncology seems important to determine operative risks and benefits and to guide perioperative management.			2016				7660
Prosthetic interventions for people with transtibial amputation: Systematic review and meta-analysis of high-quality prospective literature and systematic reviews		Highsmith, M. J., Kahle, J. T., Miro, R. M., Orendurff, M. S., Lewandowski, A. L., Orriola, J. J., Sutton, B. and Ertl, J. P.				journal of rehabilitation research and development	journal of rehabilitation research and development	Considering transtibial amputation (TTA) rehabilitation costs and complexity, high-quality literature should inform clinical practice. Systematic reviews (SRs) suggest this is not the case. This article's purpose was to review the highest-quality evidence available to guide clinical practice for TTA regarding five prosthetic intervention areas. Six databases were searched for high-quality SRs and prospective clinical trials (randomized clinical trials [RCTs]). Reviewers screened, sorted, rated (i.e., methodologic quality, bias risk), and extracted article data. Meta-analyses were conducted when possible. Thirty-one references were included (25 RCTs and 6 SRs). Five topical areas emerged (alignment, feet and ankles, interface, postoperative care, pylons). Twenty-three evidence statements were supported by level 2 evidence and eight by level 1 evidence. All RCTs reported randomization and reasonable data presentation. Concealed allocation and blinding were not widely used. Mean attrition was 11%. SRs included no meta-analyses. Functional level was poorly reported. Grouping feet and ankle components by functional classification enabled meta-analyses, though variance was considerable given the small sample sizes. Prosthetic interventions are generally safe for TTAs. High-quality literature enabled formulation of evidence statements to support select clinical practice areas, though quantity was lacking. Thus, numerous topics related to TTA care lack rigorous evidence. Although blinding in prosthetic research requires increased funding and effort, it could greatly improve the methodologic quality of prosthetic research.			2016				5965
Clinical performance of removable dental prostheses in the moderately reduced dentition: a systematic literature review		Moldovan, O., Rudolph, H. and Luthardt, R. G.				clinical oral investigations	clinical oral investigations	OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based therapeutic recommendations for removable dental prostheses are still lacking. The aim of the present study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of the survival rates of removable dentures in the moderately reduced dentition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2014, a systematic literature search in established medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, SciSearch, Cochrane, FIZ Technik Web) and a hand search of relevant dental journals were conducted. The search terms were relevant MeSH terms, free search terms, and combinations of the two. The search included RCTs, prospective and retrospective studies on survival rates of removable dental prostheses in the moderately reduced dentition with at least 15 participants, an observation period of at least 2 years, and a dropout rate of less than 25 %. The selection of relevant publications was carried out at the title, abstract, and full-text level by at least two of the authors involved. The publications included were tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the original 12,994 matches, 1923 were analyzed by title, 650 by abstract, and 111 according to the full text. The final review included 19 publications, of which 6 were multiple publications. Cast-metal framework dentures exhibited failure rates of between 33 and 50 % after 5 years. One study with a 25-year observation period reported failure rates of 50 %. Better results were obtained with proper pretreatment and a good recall scheme. Bilateral attachment prostheses showed failure rates of between 11 and 30 % after 5 years. Unilateral attachment prostheses showed failure rates of 75 % after 5 years. Double-crown prostheses dentures show failure rates of 0 to 21.7 % after 3 to 6 years. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous study designs and data analyses rendered a meta-analysis impossible, so that an evaluation at the highest level of evidence could not be performed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Within the limitations of this study, it would be correct to state that removable dental prostheses, given suitable pretreatment and follow-up regimes, can provide satisfactory solutions. Based on only one paper, they revealed acceptable results even over a very long observation period (25 years).			2016				6377
Efficacy of lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Liang, L., Zhao, M., Zhu, Y. C., Hu, X., Yang, L. P. and Liu, H.				annals of hematology	annals of hematology	Therapeutic results of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are very disappointing at present. Lenalidomide has been proved to be effective for relapsed/refractory CLL as a single agent or in combination with various chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens. However, current clinical experience in its usage is still limited. Because of existing considerable variability in different studies, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to describe overall response rate (ORR) of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Pooled estimate of cumulative prevalence of total ORR was 42.23 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 32.49-52.61 %), while pooled ORR in regimen with lenalidomide plus anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAbs) and lenalidomide mono-therapy were 60.01 % (95 % CI, 53.86-65.86 %) and 24.38 % (95 % CI, 16.15-35.06 %), respectively. There was no significant difference between L + R (lenalidomide plus rituximab) group and L + O (lenalidomide plus ofatumumab) group, with pooled ORR of 66.38 % (95 % CI, 57.96-73.87 %) and 57.40 % (95 % CI, 46.46-67.65 %), respectively. When co-administrated with anti-CD20 mAbs, dosage of lenalidomide was not the key factor of ORR in combination therapy. Pooled ORR of patient with high-risk cytogenetic in L + anti-CD20 mAbs group was 56.74 % (95 % CI, 45.53-67.30 %). In comparison with patients without high-risk cytogenetic receiving the same treatment regimen, no significant difference was observed, with relative risk (RR) of 0.87 (95 % CI 0.68-1.11). Our finding demonstrated that lenalidomide plus anti-CD20 mAbs could be an efficient therapy regimen for relapsed/refractory CLL patients, especially for those with high-risk cytogenetic factor.			2016				7044
Effectiveness of social media in reducing risk factors for noncommunicable diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials		Mita, G., Ni Mhurchu, C. and Jull, A.				nutrition reviews	nutrition reviews	OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of the current study was to synthesize evidence of the effect of social media use compared with no social media use as part of interventions to reduce risk factors for noncommunicable diseases. DATA SOURCES: Databases were searched up to June 10, 2014, using medical subject headings. A secondary aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of social media use compared with no social media use in reducing the risk factors for noncommunicable diseases, stratifying the results by the extent of bias on outcomes, by social media use alone, and by the levels of social presence and media richness. STUDY SELECTION: Sixteen trials (n=10?711 participants) met the inclusion criteria, but interventions mostly used social media with low levels of media richness and presence (e.g., discussion boards, bulletin boards). DATA SYNTHESIS: Meta-analysis of all trials showed no significant differences (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.14; 95%CI -0.28 to 0.01), with similar findings for physical activity (SMD 0.07; 95%CI -0.25 to 0.38), body weight (SMD 0.07; 95%CI -0.17 to 0.20), and fruit and vegetable intake (SMD 0.39; 95%CI -0.11 to 0.89). Trials assessing social media interventions aimed at modifying risk factors for noncommunicable diseases showed that social media use improved the primary outcomes, but the overall quality of the included studies limits the generalizability of these findings. CONCLUSION: Further trials are warranted, especially to isolate the effect of social media use and to fully evaluate the effect of the social presence and media richness of social media platforms.			2016				9680
A systematic review of the use of lasers for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa		John, H., Manoloudakis, N. and Stephen Sinclair, J.				journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : jpras	journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : jpras	AIM: To conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of various types of lasers (and light based therapies) for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and to establish recommendations based on our findings. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane and PubMed databases. STUDY SELECTION: English language studies describing the use of laser for the treatment of HS. DATA EXTRACTION: Multiple reviewers performed independent extraction and identified 22 studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: Studies were categorised according to grading recommendations based on evidence quality guidelines for systematic reviews. Only 2 studies met criteria to be assigned the highest grade. CONCLUSION: Nd:YAG laser has been shown to be effective for the treatment of HS, as is intense pulsed light therapy (IPL) using the same principles of laser hair removal. There is weak evidence to recommend the use of carbon dioxide, diode or alexandrite lasers. The need for larger randomized controlled trials is highlighted.			2016				5751
The Effect of Supplementation of Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids During Lactation on Neurodevelopmental Outcomes of Preterm Infant From Infancy to School Age: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Wang, Q., Cui, Q. and Yan, C.				pediatric neurology	pediatric neurology	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid, have been suggested as a nutrition factor affecting visual and neurobehavioral development of preterm infants. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the effect of supplementation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids on preterm infants. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation of formula or breast milk on the neurodevelopment outcomes of preterm infants. METHODS: Two authors searched PubMed and Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for RCTs assessing efficacy of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation on the neurobehavioral and development outcomes of preterm infant. Human RCTs which supplemented long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids during lactation and assessed neurodevelopment were included. The quality of each RCT was assessed, and the results of eligible trials were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs with 2272 total participants. Methodologic limitations existed to some extent in most RCTs that were included. Because the age of the participants from different trails was not the same, different scales and indexes had been assessed from different RCTs. Our meta-analysis indicated a significant effect of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation on the neurodevelopment of preterm infants assessed by the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales at one to three years of age versus the control groups. CONCLUSION: Analysis of our consolidated data indicates that long-chain fatty acid supplementation results in a significant improvement in the neurodevelopment of preterm infants as assessed by the Mental Development Index at one to three years of age. The available evidence suggests that long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation during lactation may accelerate the pace of neurodevelopment in preterm infants, although their final developmental outcome may be unchanged.			2016				7884
An updated systematic review of the evolution of ALPPS and evaluation of its advantages and disadvantages in accordance with current evidence		Cai, Y. L., Song, P. P., Tang, W. and Cheng, N. S.				medicine	medicine	The main obstacle to achieving an R0 resection after a major hepatectomy is inability to preserve an adequate future liver remnant (FLR) to avoid postoperative liver failure (PLF). Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) is a novel technique for resecting tumors that were previously considered unresectable, and this technique results in a vast increase in the volume of the FLR in a short period of time. However, this technique continues to provoke heated debate because of its high mortality and morbidity.The evolution of ALPPS and its advantages and disadvantages have been systematically reviewed and evaluated in accordance with current evidence. Electronic databases (PubMed and Medline) were searched for potentially relevant articles from January 2007 to January 2016.ALPPS has evolved into various modified forms. Some of these modified techniques have reduced the difficulty of the procedure and enhanced its safety. Current evidence indicates that the advantages of ALPPS are rapid hypertrophy of the FLR, the feasibility of the procedure, and a higher rate of R0 resection in comparison to other techniques. However, ALPPS is associated with worse major complications, more deaths, and early tumor recurrence.Hepatobiliary surgeons should carefully consider whether to perform ALPPS. Some modified forms of ALPPS have reduced the mortality and morbidity of the procedure, but they cannot be recommended over the original procedure currently. Portal vein embolization (PVE) is still the procedure of choice for patients with a tumor-free FLR, and ALPPS could be used as a salvage procedure when PVE fails. More persuasive evidence needs to be assembled to determine whether ALPPS or two-stage hepatectomy (TSH) is better for patients with a tumor involving the FLR. Evidence with regard to long-term oncological outcomes is still limited. More meticulous comparative studies and studies of the 5-year survival rate of ALPPS could ultimately help to determine the usefulness of ALPPS. Indications and patient selection for the procedure need to be determined.			2016				10085
The effectiveness of interventions to meet family needs of critically ill patients in an adult intensive care unit: a systematic review update		Kynoch, K., Chang, A., Coyer, F. and McArdle, A.				jbi database of systematic reviews and implementation reports	jbi database of systematic reviews and implementation reports	BACKGROUND: Attending to the needs of family members of critically ill patients is an important and necessary step in providing appropriate holistic care for both the patient and the family. Family interaction can significantly impact on the experience of critical illness, notwithstanding the challenge of meeting families' needs for many clinicians in the intensive care unit (ICU). Family needs have been extensively researched; however, a previous Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) systematic review was the first published systematic review recommending effective interventions for addressing family needs of critically ill patients in an acute intensive care setting. Since its publication in 2011, additional research findings have been published and it was deemed appropriate to update the original systematic review. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to establish recent best practice in addressing the needs of family members with a relative or loved one admitted to an adult critical care unit. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Studies that included family members (including children) of adult patients in an ICU were considered for inclusion in this review. Patients with any clinical condition, length of stay or outcome were included. TYPES OF INTERVENTION(S): This review considered interventions that addressed the five previously identified categories of family needs: support - support groups, training in coping strategies and journal or diary writing; assurance - face-to-face meetings and participation in ward rounds; proximity - changes to visitation policies; information - staff and/or family education, handouts and brochures and the use of technology (e.g. SMS messages); and comfort - changes to the ICU physical environment. TYPES OF STUDIES: This review considered any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of interventions in addressing family needs of critically ill patients in an adult ICU. In the absence of RCTs, other research designs such as quasi-experimental, as well as pre- and post-studies were considered for inclusion in the narrative summary to enable the identification of current approaches and possible future strategies for addressing family needs of critically ill patients. TYPES OF OUTCOMES: This review considered studies that evaluated outcomes with a validated tool that measured information comprehension, coping mechanisms, anxiety, depression, stress and satisfaction. SEARCH STRATEGY: An extensive search of the major databases was conducted. Databases searched included PubMed, CINAHL, psycINFO, Health source, Web of Science, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. The original search of this review included published and unpublished studies and articles in English from 1980 to 2010. The updated search identified articles for inclusion from 2010 to 2014. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Quantitative articles selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review. Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. DATA EXTRACTION: Data was extracted from the articles included in this review using standardized data extraction tools from the JBI Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument package. DATA SYNTHESIS: The studies included in this review were not suitable for meta-analysis and therefore the results are presented as a narrative summary. RESULTS: Originally, 14 studies and one dissertation met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Of these, 12 were quasi-experimental studies and three were prospective randomized trials. In this current update, 14 new articles were identified for inclusion - one RCT, 10 quasi-experimental studies and three observational studies. The settings were in ICUs in Sweden, USA, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and Iran. The evidence identified from all studies in the review includes the use of support groups for family members of patients admitted to an ICU, structured communication and/or education programs for family members, the use of leaflets or brochures to meet family information needs, use of a diary, changes in the physical environment and open or more flexible visiting hours. CONCLUSIONS: This current update of the original review makes several reiterative and new recommendations for clinical practice to address family needs of patients admitted to a critical care unit; however, the need for significant further research in this area is again highlighted. Future intervention studies focusing on family needs could include the use of technology such as DVDs (Digital Versatile Discs) and SMS (Short Message Service) for informing families and interventions specifically designed to improve family comfort. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Communication interventions help promote family involvement in their loved one's care and facilitate their decision-making capacity, as well as improving clinician and family interaction, family comprehension of their loved one's condition and also reduce the development of post-traumatic stress-related symptoms (Grade A). Family satisfaction may be increased with the provision of comfortable physical environments with noise reduction measures (Grade B). IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: More rigorous high-quality studies investigating interventions to meet the needs of family with a relative in ICU are needed. The majority of included studies in this updated review focused on family satisfaction wherein more robust data on family needs would better inform health professionals in their practice.			2016				7653
Long-Term Pharmacological Treatments of Anxiety Disorders: An Updated Systematic Review		Perna, G., Alciati, A., Riva, A., Micieli, W. and Caldirola, D.				current psychiatry reports	current psychiatry reports	Many aspects of long-term pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders (AnxDs) are still debated. We undertook an updated systematic review of long-term pharmacological studies on panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Relevant studies dating from January 1, 2012 to August 31, 2015 were identified using the PubMed database and a review of bibliographies. Of 372 records identified in the search, five studies on PD and 15 on GAD were included in the review. No studies on SAD were found. Our review confirms the usefulness of long-term pharmacological treatments for PD and GAD and suggests that they can provide further improvement over that obtained during short-term therapy. Paroxetine, escitalopram, and clonazepam can be effective for long-term treatment of PD. However, further studies are needed to draw conclusions about the long-term benzodiazepine use in PD, particularly for the possible cognitive side-effects over time. Pregabalin and quetiapine can be effective for long-term treatment of GAD, while preliminary suggestions emerged for agomelatine and vortioxetine. We did not find any evidence for determining the optimal length and/or dosage of medications to minimize the relapse risk. Few investigations have attempted to identify potential predictors of long-term treatment response. Personalized treatments for AnxDs can be implemented using predictive tools to explore those factors affecting treatment response/tolerability heterogeneity, including neurobiological functions/clinical profiles, comorbidity, biomarkers, and genetic features, and to tailor medications according to each patient's unique features.			2016				5463
Dental implants in the elderly population: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Srinivasan, M., Meyer, S., Mombelli, A. and Müller, F.				clinical oral implants research	clinical oral implants research	OBJECTIVE: This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the outcome of dental implant therapy in elderly patients (?65 years). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Online database and hand searches were systematically performed to identify studies reporting on dental implants placed in the partially/completely edentulous jaws of elderly patients. Only prospective studies reporting on regular-diameter (?3 mm), micro-rough surface implants were included in this review. Two investigators performed the search and data extraction. An inter-investigator reliability was verified using kappa statistics (?). A meta-analysis was performed on implant survival rates, while the mean peri-implant marginal bone level changes (PI-MBL), technical/mechanical complications, and biological complications were reported descriptively. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded 2221 publications, of which 11 studies were included for statistical analyses. The calculated ? for the various parameters extracted was ? = 0.818-1.000. A meta-analysis was performed on the post-loading implant survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. The random-effects model revealed an overall 1-year implant survival of 97.7% (95% CI: 95.8, 98.8; I(2)  = 0.00%, P = 0.968; n = 11 studies). The model further revealed an overall implant survival of 96.3% (95% CI: 92.8, 98.1; I(2)  = 0.00%, P = 0.618; n = 6 studies), 96.2% (95% CI: 93.0, 97.9; I(2)  = 0.00%, P = 0.850; n = 7 studies), and 91.2% (95% CI: 83.4, 95.6; I(2)  = 0.00%, P = 0.381; n = 3 studies) for 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The reported 1-year average PI-MBL ranged between 0.1 and 0.3 mm, while the reported 5- and 10-year PI-MBL were 0.7 and 1.5 mm, respectively. Information obtained pertaining to the technical and biological complications in the included studies was inadequate for statistical analysis. The frequent technical/mechanical complications reported were abutment screw loosening, fracture of the overdenture prostheses, activation of retentive clips, ceramic chipping, and fractures. The common biological complication reported included peri-implant mucositis, mucosal enlargement, bone loss, pain, and implant loss. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides robust evidence favoring dental implant therapy in elderly patients as a predictable long-term treatment option, in terms of implant survival, clinically acceptable PI-MBL changes, and minimal complications. Therefore, age alone should not be a limiting factor for dental implant therapy.			2017				4375
Health Economic Evaluations of Sofosbuvir for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C: a Systematic Review		Luhnen, M., Waffenschmidt, S., Gerber-Grote, A. and Hanke, G.				applied health economics and health policy	applied health economics and health policy	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The approval of sofosbuvir offers new therapeutic options for patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C. In phase III trials, it has demonstrated significantly greater efficacy and safety in comparison with the old standard of care. In addition, it provides the first interferon-free regimen allowing treatment of patients without previous therapeutic options. A current debate regarding pricing and affordability can be attributed to high treatment costs. The objective of this review was to compare health economic evaluations of sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in terms of models, patient populations, interventions and results. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the data sources Medline (1946-09/2015), Embase (1974-09/2015), the Health Technology Assessment Database (September 2015) and the UK National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (September 2015). We included health economic evaluations that measured the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based regimens compared with regimens without sofosbuvir for the treatment of adult patients infected with chronic hepatitis C. The articles were then critically appraised regarding the effectiveness data, cost data and models utilised. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included, which analysed the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir in seven different countries. Differences in study characteristics were found regarding study populations, modelling and willingness-to-pay thresholds. The study results demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of the treatment combination of sofosbuvir with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in comparison with the old standard of care. Dual therapy with sofosbuvir and ribavirin was considered cost effective only in comparison with no therapy. CONCLUSION: Despite high costs, the included studies indicate that sofosbuvir-based regimens are cost effective in most patients. While the results are unequivocal with regard to sofosbuvir-based triple therapy, the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based dual therapy heavily depends on country-specific willingness to pay. Although interferon-containing triple therapy has now been replaced by newly approved direct-acting antivirals in most middle- and high-income countries, the availability of these oral treatment combinations is poor in low-income countries. Therefore, the findings of our review are still of relevance.			2016				6310
Efficacy of Stem Cell Therapy in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Moura, M. C., Novaes, M. R., Zago, Y. S., Eduardo, E. J. and Casulari, L. A.				journal of clinical medicine research	journal of clinical medicine research	BACKGROUND: Published studies seeking to improve survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have poor results in humans, although there are several studies in animal models with positive results. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that were published between March 2009 and March 2015 on stem cell therapy and survival in animal models and patients with ALS. A total of 714 articles were identified, and from these, we selected preclinical in vivo studies and retrospective clinical studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A meta-analysis confirmed the efficacy of stem cell therapy in improving survival in preclinical trials, where a mean difference of 9.79 days (95% confidence interval: 4.45 - 15.14) in lifespan favored stem cell therapy. In contrast, the number of clinical studies is still insufficient to assess their effectiveness, and these studies only demonstrate the absence of serious adverse events. However, even this conclusion should be interpreted with caution because clinical studies are retrospective and heterogeneous and have an unsatisfactory quality.			2016				6741
Total versus partial splenectomy in pediatric hereditary spherocytosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Guizzetti, L.				pediatric blood & cancer	pediatric blood & cancer	To compare the clinical effectiveness of total splenectomy (TS) or partial splenectomy (PS) in pediatric hereditary spherocytosis, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed (PROSPERO registration CRD42015030056). There were 14 observational studies comparing pre- and postoperative hematologic parameters. Secondary outcomes include in-hospital infections, surgical complications, symptomatic recurrence, and biliary disease. TS is more effective than PS to increase hemoglobin (3.6 g/dl vs. 2.2 g/dl) and reduce reticulocytes (12.5% vs. 6.5%) after 1 year; outcomes following PS are stable for at least 6 years. There were no cases of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis. A population-based patient registry is needed for long-term follow-up.			2016				5818
Effects of neurostimulation for advanced Parkinson's disease patients on motor symptoms: A multiple-treatments meta-analysas of randomized controlled trials		Xie, C. L., Shao, B., Chen, J., Zhou, Y., Lin, S. Y. and Wang, W. W.				scientific reports	scientific reports	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the surgical procedure of choice for patients with advanced Parkinson disease (PD). We aim to evaluate the efficacy of GPi (globus pallidus internus), STN (subthalamic nucleus)-DBS and medical therapy for PD. We conducted a systematic review and multiple-treatments meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of neurostimulation and medical therapy for PD patients. Sixteen eligible studies were included in this analysis. We pooled the whole data and found obvious difference between GPi-DBS versus medical therapy and STN-DBS versus medical therapy in terms of UPDRS scores (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). Meanwhile, we found GPi-DBS had the similar efficacy on the UPDRS scores when compared with STN-DBS. What is more, quality of life, measured by PDQ-39 (Parkinson's disease Questionnaire) showed greater improvement after GPi-DBS than STN-DBS. Five studies showed STN-DBS was more effective for reduction in medication than GPi-DBS. Overall, either GPi-DBS or STN-DBS was an effective technique to control PD patients' symptoms and improved their functionality and quality of life. Meanwhile, the UPDRS scores measuring parkinsonian symptoms revealed no significant difference between GPi-DBS and STN-DBS. STN-DBS was more effective for reduction in medication than GPi-DBS. Alternatively, GPi-DBS was more effective for improving the PDQ-39 score than STN-DBS.			2016				10593
Systematic review and meta-analysis of acupuncture to reduce cancer-related pain		Chiu, H. Y., Hsieh, Y. J. and Tsai, P. S.				european journal of cancer care	european journal of cancer care	We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on malignancy-related, chemotherapy (CT)- or radiation therapy (RT)-induced, surgery-induced, and hormone therapy (HT)-induced pain. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of acupuncture on cancer-related pain were reached from the EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Airiti library, Taiwan Electrical Periodical Service, Wanfang Data (a Chinese database) and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database from inception through June 2014. Heterogeneity, moderator analysis, publication bias and risk of bias associated with the included studies were examined. A total of 29 RCTs yielding 36 effect sizes were included. The overall effect of acupuncture on cancer-related pain was -0.45 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.63 to -0.26]. The subanalysis indicated that acupuncture relieved malignancy-related and surgery-induced pain [effect size (g) = -0.71, and -0.40; 95% CI = -0.94 to -0.48, and -0.69 to -0.10] but not CT- or RT-induced and HT-induced pain (g = -0.05, and -0.64, 95% CI = -0.33 to 0.24, and -1.55 to 0.27). Acupuncture is effective in relieving cancer-related pain, particularly malignancy-related and surgery-induced pain. Our findings suggest that acupuncture can be adopted as part of a multimodal approach for reducing cancer-related pain.			2017				4225
Strategies for Medical Management of Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis - A Systematic Review		Chawla, N., Deshmukh, M., Sharma, A. and Patole, S.				journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition	journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition	OBJECTIVE: Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is associated with significant morbidity in children. Strategies for optimizing its outcomes are hence essential. We aimed to review the strategies for medical management of EoE in children. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review (SR) of randomized controlled trials (RCT) of medical interventions in children with EoE, using the Cochrane methodology. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Library, and Google scholar were searched up to March 2016. Primary outcomes included histological (peak eosinophil count) and symptomatic remission. Secondary outcomes were improvement in endoscopic and other histological parameters and adverse effects. RESULTS: A total of 5 RCTs (N?=?448) with low to unclear risk of bias were included. The interventions included topical oral steroids, swallowed enteral steroids and anti-IL5 agent. Pooling of data from all trials was not possible due to significant heterogeneity in interventions. Meta-analysis of data (N?=?141) from three RCTs (Oral viscous Budesonide: 2, Fluticasone: 1) showed significant histological remission in the intervention vs. control group participants [RR: 10.32 (95% Confidence interval: 3.04, 35.03); p?=?0.0002], Level of evidence - low. Compared with anti-IL5 agent, the trials assessing steroids reported high rates of clinical remission. Clinical remission did not correlate with histological improvement in any trial. Except for systemic corticosteroids, there were no significant adverse effects related to other interventions. CONCLUSION: Limited low quality evidence exists on the effects of various interventions in children with EoE. The beneficial effects of swallowed steroid need to be confirmed in large well-designed RCTs.			2016				6195
CT colonography for surveillance of patients with colorectal cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic efficacy		Porté, F., Uppara, M., Malietzis, G., Faiz, O., Halligan, S., Athanasiou, T. and Burling, D.				european radiology	european radiology	PURPOSE: To review primary research evidence investigating performance of CT colonography for colorectal cancer surveillance. The financial impact of using CT colonography for surveillance was also estimated. METHODS: We identified primary studies of CT colonography for surveillance of colorectal cancer patients. A summary ROC curve was constructed. Inter-study heterogeneity was explored using the I2 value. Financial impact was estimated for a theoretical cohort of patients, based on Cancer Research UK statistics. RESULTS: Seven studies provided data on 880 patients. Five of seven studies (765 patients) were included for qualitative analysis. Sensitivity of CT colonography for detection of anastomotic recurrence was 95 % (95 % CI 62?-?100), specificity 100 % (95 % CI 75?-?100) and sensitivity for metachronous cancers was 100 %. No statistical heterogeneity was detected (I2?=?0 %). We estimated that CT colonography as a 'single test' alternative to colonoscopy and standard CT for surveillance would potentially save 20,785,232 (£14,803,404) for an annual cohort of UK patients. CONCLUSION: CT colonography compares favourably to colonoscopy for detection of anastomotic recurrence and metachronous colorectal cancer, and appears financially beneficial. These findings should be considered alongside limitations of small patient numbers and high clinical heterogeneity between studies. KEY POINTS:  CT colonography compares favourably to colonoscopy/standard CT for colorectal cancer surveillance.  CT colonography offers single-test luminal, serosal and extra-colonic assessment.  CT colonography is a potentially cost-saving alternative to standard surveillance protocols.			2017				4875
Effect of Bisphosphonates, Denosumab, and Radioisotopes on Bone Pain and Quality of Life in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Bone Metastases: A Systematic Review		Hendriks, L. E., Hermans, B. C., van den Beuken-van Everdingen, M. H., Hochstenbag, M. M. and Dingemans, A. M.				journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the international association for the study of lung cancer	journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the international association for the study of lung cancer	Bone metastases are common in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), often causing pain and a decrease in quality of life (QoL). The effect of bone-targeted agents is evaluated by reduction in skeletal-related events in which neither pain nor QoL are included. Radioisotopes can be administered for more diffuse bone pain that is not eligible for palliative radiotherapy. The evidence that bone-targeted agents relieve pain or improve QoL is not solid. We performed a systematic review of the effect of bone-targeted agents on pain and QoL in patients with NSCLC. Our systematic literature search included original articles or abstracts reporting on bisphosphonates, denosumab, or radioisotopes or combinations thereof in patients with bone metastases (?5 patients with NSCLC), with pain, QoL, or both serving as the primary or secondary end point. Of the twenty-five eligible studies, 13 examined bisphosphonates (one also examined denosumab) and 12 dealt with radioisotopes. None of the randomized studies on bisphosphonates or denosumab evaluated pain and QoL as the primary end point. In the single-arm studies of bisphosphonates a decrease in pain or analgesic consumption was found for 38% to 77% of patients. QoL was included in five of 13 studies, but improvement was found in only two. No high-level evidence that bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce pain or improve QoL was found. Although the data are limited, radioisotopes seem to reduce pain with a rapid onset of action and duration of response of 1 to 3 months. The evidence that bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce or prevent pain in patients with NSCLC and bone metastases or that they have an influence on QoL is very weak. Radioisotopes can be used to reduce diffuse pain, although there is no high-level evidence supporting such use.			2016				7936
Azapirones for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review		Matsui, Y., Matsunaga, S., Matsuda, Y., Kishi, T. and Iwata, N.				pharmacopsychiatry	pharmacopsychiatry	Introduction: No meta-analysis has evaluated azapirones (serotonin1A receptor partial agonists) as anxiolytics for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and single-arm trials published before October 27, 2015 were retrieved from major healthcare databases and clinical trial registries. Relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: 5 RCTs (n=429) and 3 single-arm studies (n=70) were identified. 3 RCTs compared buspirone vs. methylphenidate in children/adolescents, one buspirone patches vs. placebo patches in children/adolescents, and one atomoxetine plus buspirone vs. atomoxetine vs. placebo in adults. The single-arm studies were buspirone trails in children/adolescents. All-cause discontinuation rates and adverse events did not differ between pooled buspirone and methylphenidate groups. No other meta-analyses of buspirone efficacy and safety vs. comparators were conducted due to insufficient data. 2 RCTs found no significant differences in parent and teacher ADHD-Rating Scale total scores between buspirone and methylphenidate, while one reported that methylphenidate improved parent and teacher ADHD-RS total scores vs. buspirone. Discussion: It remains unclear whether buspirone use has benefit for ADHD patients and therefore further evidence is needed for better clinical use of buspirone in patients with ADHD.			2016				8389
Managing missed lower extremity compartment syndrome in the physiologically stable patient: A systematic review and lessons from a level I trauma center		Glass, G. E., Staruch, R. M., Simmons, J., Lawton, G., Nanchahal, J., Jain, A. and Hettiaratchy, S. P.				the journal of trauma and acute care surgery	the journal of trauma and acute care surgery	"BACKGROUND: Decompressing an acute lower extremity compartment syndrome salvages muscle and nerve and preserves limb function. However reperfusion of ischemic tissue causes a systemic insult that can be life-threatening. Hence, the management of missed acute lower limb compartment syndrome remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the literature and, together with our own experience from a level 1 trauma centre, clarify the management of missed compartment syndrome in the physiologically stable patient. METHODS: Pubmed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane database of systematic reviews and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials was searched. Studies were evaluated using the GRADE methodology. In addition, our trauma database was searched (2005-May 2015) for additional cases and a multidisciplinary case note review was conducted for all cases identified. This study was registered prospectively on the PROSPERO database (CRD42015026098). RESULTS: Our systematic review yielded 9 studies, including one case-controlled study, 3 case series and 5 case reports with a total of 57 patients and 64 limbs. Overall study quality was ""very low"" with the exception of the case-controlled study which was ""low"". Delayed compartment decompression (6-120 hours) resulted in amputation rates of 5 of 24, 8 of 19, 4 of 5 and 2 of 3 limbs. Two patients died of complications associated with late compartment decompression. One compartment syndrome of the buttock was managed non-operatively. Most surviving limbs exhibited functional deficits.Additionally, our experience comprised 10 cases. Of the 6 who underwent compartment decompression the burden of subsequent morbidity included 3 amputations (one above knee), 2 complete foot drops and one episode of severe sepsis. As this experience mirrored the poor outcomes reported in the literature, we managed the 4 most recent cases non-operatively. All remain ambulant with incomplete foot drops or limb weakness. CONCLUSION: Surgical decompression of missed acute lower limb compartment syndrome yields an early physiological insult and a high late amputation rate. Managing selected cases non-operatively may result in less early morbidity and yield superior long term results but the evidence remains sparse and of poor quality. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Systematic review, level II. SOURCE OF FUNDING: none."			2016				7830
Patients with sciatica still experience pain and disability 5 years after surgery: A systematic review with meta-analysis of cohort studies		Machado, G. C., Witzleb, A. J., Fritsch, C., Maher, C. G., Ferreira, P. H. and Ferreira, M. L.				european journal of pain (london, england)	european journal of pain (london, england)	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The clinical course of patients with sciatica is believed to be favourable, but there is conflicting evidence on the postoperative course of this condition. We aimed to investigate the clinical course of sciatica following surgery. DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: An electronic search was conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL from inception to April 2015. We screened for prospective cohort studies investigating pain or disability outcomes for patients with sciatica treated surgically. Fractional polynomial regression analysis was used to generate pooled means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of pain and disability up to 5 years after surgery. Estimates of pain and disability (converted to a 0-100 scale) were plotted over time, from inception to last available follow-up time. RESULTS: Forty records (39 cohort studies) were included with a total of 13,883 patients with sciatica. Before surgery, the pooled mean leg pain score was 75.2 (95% CI 68.1-82.4) which reduced to 15.3 (95% CI 8.5-22.1) at 3 months. Patients were never fully recovered in the long-term and pain increased to 21.0 (95% CI 12.5-29.5) at 5 years. The pooled mean disability score before surgery was 55.1 (95% CI 52.3-58.0) and this decreased to 15.5 (95% CI 13.3-17.6) at 3 months, and further reduced to 13.1 (95% CI 10.6-15.5) at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgery is followed by a rapid decrease in pain and disability by 3 months, patients still experience mild to moderate pain and disability 5 years after surgery. WHAT DOES THIS REVIEW ADD?: This review provides a quantitative summary of the postoperative course of patients with sciatica. Patients with sciatica experienced a rapid reduction in pain and disability in the first 3 months, but still had mild to moderate symptoms 5 years after surgery. Although no significant differences were found, microdiscectomy showed larger improvements compared to other surgical techniques.			2016				9636
Bucher's indirect comparison of daylight photodynamic therapy with methyl aminolevulinate cream versus diclofenac plus hyaluronic acid gel for the treatment of multiple actinic keratosis		Calzavara-Pinton, P., Zane, C., Pacou, M. and Szeimies, R. M.				european journal of dermatology : ejd	european journal of dermatology : ejd	Actinic keratosis (AK) is a pre-cancerous condition characterised by patches of thick, scaly skin developing on sun-exposed areas of the body. When multiple AKs develop on severely photodamaged skin, commonly used treatments include photodynamic therapy and diclofenac plus hyaluronic acid gel (DHA). Methyl aminolevulinate daylight photodynamic therapy (MAL DL-PDT) is an alternative to conventional photodynamic therapy (MAL c-PDT). Trials have indicated that MAL DL-PDT is as effective as MAL c-PDT but reduces treatment-related pain and dermatological side effects. To indirectly compare between MAL DL-PDT and DHA in patients with AK. A total of three randomised trials were collected using a systematic literature review. An adjusted indirect comparison was conducted on complete lesion response rate at 12 weeks. The data indicated that mild lesions, moderate lesions, and mild and moderate lesions treated with MAL DL-PDT were more than four times more likely to undergo a complete response than lesions treated with DHA at 12 weeks, with ORs ranging from 4.23 to 4.81. Results were all statistically significant. This is the first indirect comparison demonstrating the effectiveness of MAL-PDT over DHA for the treatment of AK, and further research is needed to assess the long-term efficacy of these interventions (i.e. six months and beyond), as well as safety and patient-reported outcomes.			2016				10607
The effectiveness of ayurvedic oil-based nasal instillation (Nasya) medicines in the treatment of facial paralysis (Ardita): a systematic review		Vivera, M. J. and Gomersall, J. S.				jbi database of systematic reviews and implementation reports	jbi database of systematic reviews and implementation reports	BACKGROUND: Ardita (facial paralysis) is a medical condition that disfigures or distorts the facial appearance of the sufferer causing facial asymmetry and malfunction. Ardita patients may benefit from considering alternative treatments such as Ayurveda, including Taila Nasya (nasal instillation of medicated oil). OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of different Nasya oils in the treatment of Ardita. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Studies conducted on adult sufferers (18-70 years) of Ardita (chronic or acute) in any setting were considered. Studies including participants who were pregnant or suffered allergic rhinitis, fever, intracranial tumor/hemorrhage and bilateral facial palsy were excluded. INTERVENTION(S)/COMPARATOR(S): Standalone treatment of Nasya (at all dosages and frequencies) compared to Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic treatments was considered. Comparisons between different interventions including Taila Nasya alone, Taila Nasya in combination with other Ayurvedic interventions and Ayurvedic interventions that did not include Taila Nasya were also considered. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in Ardita symptoms, including facial distortion, speech disorders and facial pain, were measured. TYPES OF STUDIES: All quantitative study designs (experimental, quasi-experimental and observational) were considered. SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant studies were identified following a comprehensive literature search. References provided within these key studies identified additional resources. Indian universities were also contacted for results of Ardita studies undertaken in their institutions.A three-step search strategy aimed to find studies of published and unpublished studies was undertaken. Studies published in the English language were considered for inclusion, irrespective of publication date/year. Following an initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL, the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe each articles were analyzed. From the identified keywords and index terms, searches were undertaken across all relevant databases such as PubMed, CINHAL, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Scopus, Centre for Review and Dissemination databases, Turning Research into Practice (TRIP), EMBASE, EBM Reviews, DHARA, Google Scholar, MedNar and ProQuest Dissertations. Finally, reference lists of identified theses and articles were searched for additional studies. Universities and website operators related to Ayurvedic research in India were contacted, including the National Institute of Ayurveda for relevant studies. Besides this, the University of Adelaide librarian was contacted to retrieve those studies identified in the reference lists of theses and articles. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Studies were critically assessed by the review author and a secondary reviewer prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Data was extracted by the primary reviewer using the standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Different interventions and comparators across studies precluded meta-analysis. Narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Only two pseudo randomized studies with a small number of participants met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One study with 20 participants, divided equally into two groups compared the effectiveness of two nasal instillations in alleviating four Ardita symptoms. The second study of 15 participants each in two groups compared the effectiveness of nasal instillation with placement of medicated oil on the head on seven Ardita symptoms. Observational measurements of Ardita symptoms were graded as Mild, Moderate or Marked at baseline and after one month. The study conducted on 30 participants using Nasya intervention showed participants had better relief from the symptoms of facial pain, speech disorder and earache within the range of 78.2% to 90.9%, graded as Marked. Along with statistical data available in the studies, this review found low levels of evidence favoring Taila Nasya intervention. The review did not include any studies examining effectiveness of Nasya compared to conventional treatment for Ardita. CONCLUSIONS: This review presents extremely limited evidence from only two small experimental studies that administration of Nasya oil alone may provide some relief from Ardita symptoms of facial distortion, speech disorder, inability to shut eyelids/upward eye rolling and dribbling of saliva in adult patients. No strong conclusions may be drawn from the evidence included in the review due to the limited number of studies, limited number of participants and poor quality of studies. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Practitioners should advice Ardita patients that there is extremely limited evidence suggesting the potential effectiveness of Nasya oils alone or Nasya in conjunction with other Ayurvedic treatments in managing symptoms. However, given the absence of a strong evidence base, practitioners should be guided by clinical wisdom and patient preference. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Well controlled clinical trials comparing standalone Nasya therapy to other Ayurvedic treatments and/or conventional medicine for Ardita symptoms need to be conducted to examine the relative effectiveness of different Nasya oils in treating Ardita.			2016				9799
The safety and efficacy of levetiracetam versus phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis after traumatic brain injury: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Xu, J. C., Shen, J., Shao, W. Z., Tang, L. J., Sun, Y. Z., Zhai, X. F., Qi, L., Li, J. and Zheng, J. Y.				brain injury	brain injury	BACKGROUND: The standard for early traumatic brain injury (TBI) seizure prophylaxis is phenytoin (PHT). Levetiracetam (LEV) has been proposed as an alternative to PHT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LEV on TBI seizure when compared with PHT. METHODS: A search was carried out based on the databases from Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane database up to May 2015. The relative risk (RR) and the relevant 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined. RESULTS: Eight observational studies and one randomized controlled trial involving 2035 cases were included. The results indicated that no significant differences in terms of overall seizure (RR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.51-1.53; p = 0.68), early seizure (RR = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.37-3.07; p = 0.92) and late seizure (RR = 1.10; 95% CI = 0.43-2.79; p = 0.85) occurrence. However, LEV was associated with a lower adverse drug reaction rate (RR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.23-0.81; p = 0.01). Moreover, there were no significant differences in terms of mortality, length of ICU or hospital stay between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis suggests that LEV appears to have a similar efficacy to PHT on TBI. A better safety profile of LEV is supported by this analysis.			2016				9643
Chinese Medicinal Herbs in the Treatment of Upper Airway Cough Syndrome: A Systematic Review of Randomized, Controlled Trials		Jiang, H., Liu, W., Li, G., Fan, T. and Mao, B.				alternative therapies in health and medicine	alternative therapies in health and medicine	Context  Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), previously called postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS), has been considered universally to be one of the most common causes of chronic cough. As an important part of complementary and alternative therapy, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has found an exact curative therapy for chronic cough through clinical practice for thousands of years. Objective  The aim of the current review was to investigate systematically the beneficial and adverse effects of Chinese medicinal herbs (CMH) in the treatment of UACS. Design  The research team performed searches in 11 main databases from respective inception to October 31, 2015, supplemented with manual retrieval of other data. Only randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the effectiveness of CMH in patients with UACS were included. Descriptive and quantitative data on the studies' designs, population demographics, interventions, outcomes, and methodological quality were extracted and tabulated. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias system and the quality of the evidence was evaluated using the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Participants  The reviewed studies included 1355 participants-720 in the CMH groups and 635 in the control groups-of both genders, from various professional and ethnic groups, and with a wide range of ages. They all had a duration of cough symptoms of longer than 8 wk and a clinical diagnosis of chronic cough induced by UACS that was supported by appropriate physical findings. Outcome Measures  The primary outcomes included (1) TCM recovery rate and (2) TCM cough symptom score. TCM's curative effect was calculated as the cumulative percentage of the symptom-score reduction (PSSR), estimated between baseline and postintervention. The cough symptom scores were graded according to the Chinese Criteria Guiding Principle of Clinical Research on New Drugs of TCM, with the scores being classified into 4 grades. Those scores ranged from 0-3 (ie, 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively), or 0-9 (ie, 0, 3, 6, 9, respectively), with the higher scores signifying a more frequent and severe cough. Results  A total of 16 studies that had been published in Chinese journals was ultimately identified for the review. The majority of methodological judgments demonstrated an unclear risk of bias. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model due to the poor homogeneity of the studies. Compared with Western medicine (WM), patients in both the CMH groups and the integrated therapy groups showed (1) a higher TCM recovery rate; (2) better relief of primary symptoms, including cough and postnasal dripping; (3) a reduction in physical signs, including the cobblestone appearance of the oropharyngeal mucosa or mucus in the oropharynx; and (4) a lower risk of cough relapse. No severe adverse events occurred in either group. Conclusions  CMH may be a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of UACS. The study highlighted the paucity of reliable clinical evidence for CMH and the need for RCTs of higher quality in the future.			2016				9579
Establishing well-being after hip fracture: a systematic review and meta-synthesis		Rasmussen, B. and Uhrenfeldt, L.				disability and rehabilitation	disability and rehabilitation	"Purpose This study aimed to identify, appraise, aggregate and synthesize findings of experiences of self-confidence and well-being after hip fracture. Method The systematic review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines. A three-step literature search strategy was followed. Included studies were critically appraised using the JBI critical appraisal tool. Data were analyzed into a meta-summary and a meta-synthesis using a hermeneutic approach. Results Twenty-nine studies were included in the analysis. The category ""balancing a new life"" was illustrated through older people's ""adaptations"", ""adjustments"" and ""worries"". The second category ""striving for interaction with new life possibilities"" was built on experiences of ""supportive interaction"", ""missing interaction"" and ""obstacles"". The abstraction of the categories into the meta-synthesis ""establishing well-being described the process of older people gradually coming to terms with new life conditions"". It was a process of building confidence through cooperation with staff. Conclusions Experiences of well-being were possible after hip fracture. Self-confidence enhanced adaptations and adjustments. Older people strived for an active everyday life where they had a sense of identity. Health professionals can facilitate the establishing of well-being through supportive interaction being aware of vulnerabilities and possibilities. This study provides information that may help in the development of interventions taking into account what is meaningful for older people. Implications for Rehabilitation Both staff and significant others play a significant role during rehabilitation after hip fracture and can give rise to both well-being and suffering. During rehabilitation, experiences of self-efficacy can be important as they support progress and adaptation towards a new way of living. After hip fracture, older people may have worries and can experience a diversity of obstacles. A sensitivity towards these experiences by health care professionals can be a support for older people striving to establish well-being after hip fracture. To enhance functional ability and experiences of independency, it may be important to consider what it is about activities that are meaningful in the lives of older people after a hip fracture."			2016				5664
Pre-endoscopic erythromycin administration in upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated meta-analysis and systematic review		Rahman, R., Nguyen, D. L., Sohail, U., Almashhrawi, A. A., Ashraf, I., Puli, S. R. and Bechtold, M. L.				annals of gastroenterology : quarterly publication of the hellenic society of gastroenterology	annals of gastroenterology : quarterly publication of the hellenic society of gastroenterology	BACKGROUND: In patients suffering from upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), adequate visualization is essential during endoscopy. Prior to endoscopy, erythromycin administration has been shown to enhance visualization in these patients; however, guidelines have not fully adopted this practice. Thus, we performed a comprehensive, up-to-date meta-analysis on the issue of erythromycin administration in this patient population. METHODS: After searching multiple databases (November 2015), randomized controlled trials on adult subjects comparing administration of erythromycin before endoscopy in UGIB patients to no erythromycin or placebo were included. Pooled estimates of adequacy of gastric mucosa visualized, need for second endoscopy, duration of procedure, length of hospital stay, units of blood transfused, and need for emergent surgery using odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) were calculated. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. RESULTS: Eight studies (n=598) were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Erythromycin administration showed statistically significant improvement in adequate gastric mucosa visualization (OR 4.14; 95% CI: 2.01-8.53, P<0.01) while reduced the need for a second-look endoscopy (OR 0.51; 95% CI: 0.34-0.77, P<0.01) and length of hospital stay (MD -1.75; 95% CI: -2.43 to -1.06, P<0.01). Duration of procedure (P=0.2), units of blood transfused (P=0.08), and need for emergent surgery (P=0.88) showed no significant differences. CONCLUSION: Pre-endoscopic erythromycin administration in UGIB patients significantly improves gastric mucosa visualization while reducing length of hospital stay and the need for second-look endoscopy.			2016				8700
The analgesic efficacy of local infiltration analgesia vs femoral nerve block after total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Albrecht, E., Guyen, O., Jacot-Guillarmod, A. and Kirkham, K. R.				british journal of anaesthesia	british journal of anaesthesia	Many consider femoral nerve block the gold standard in pain management following knee arthroplasty. Local infiltration analgesia is an alternate approach that applies the concept of surgical wound infiltration with local anaesthetics. This meta-analysis aims to compare both analgesic treatments for analgesia and functional outcomes after total knee arthroplasty. This meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA statement guidelines. The primary outcomes were cumulative i.v. morphine consumption, pain scores at rest and on movement on postoperative day one (analogue scale,0-10). Secondary outcomes included range of motion, quadriceps muscle strength, length of stay and rates of complications (neurologic events, cardiovascular events, falls and knee infections). Fourteen trials, including 1122 adult patients were identified. There was no difference in i.v. morphine consumption (mean difference: -2.0 mg; 95% CI: -4.9, 0.9 mg; I(2)=69%; P=0.19), pain scores at rest (mean difference: -0.1; 95% CI: -0.4, 0.3; I(2)=72%; P=0.80) and pain scores on movement (mean difference: 0.2; 95% CI: -0.5, 0.8; I(2)=80%; P=0.64) on postoperative day one (a negative mean difference favours local infiltration analgesia). The qualities of evidence for our primary outcomes were moderate according to the GRADE system. There were no clinical differences in functional outcomes or rates of complications. Complication rates were captured by three trials or fewer with exception of knee infection, which was sought by eight trials. Local infiltration analgesia provides similar postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty to femoral nerve block. Although this meta-analysis did not capture any difference in rates of complications, the low number of trials that specifically sought these outcomes dictates caution.			2016				9723
Efficacy and Safety of Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists for Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials		Yuan, D. M., Li, Q., Zhang, Q., Xiao, X. W., Yao, Y. W., Zhang, Y., Lv, Y. L., Liu, H. B., Lv, T. F. and Song, Y.				asian pacific journal of cancer prevention : apjcp	asian pacific journal of cancer prevention : apjcp	OBJECTIVES: Can addition of neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (NK1-RAs) be considered as an ideal strategy for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)? Researchers differ on this question. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomized control trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of NK1-RAs in preventing CINV. The primary end point was complete response (CR) in the acute, delayed, and overall phases after chemotherapy. Subgroup analyses evaluated the types of NK1-RAs, routines of administration, types of malignancies, regimens used in combination with NK1-RAs, and age of patients included in the studies. The incidences of different types of adverse events were also extracted to estimate the safety of NK1-RAs. RESULTS: A total of 38 RCTs involving 13,923 patients were identified. The CR rate of patients receiving NK-RAs was significantly higher than patients in the control groups during overall phase (70.8% vs 56.0%, <0.001), acute phase (85.1% vs 79.6%, <0.001), and delayed phase (71.4% vs 58.2%, <0.001). There were three studies including patients of children or adolescents, the CR rate was also significantly higher in the treatment group (overall phase: OR=2.807, <0.001; acute phase: OR=2.863, P =0.012; delayed phase: OR=2.417, <0.001). For all the other outcomes, patients in the NK1-RAs groups showed improvements compared to the control groups (incidence of nausea: 45.2% vs 45.9%, <0.001; occurrence of vomiting: 22.6% vs 38.9%, <0.001; usage of rescue drugs: 23.5% vs 34.1%, <0.001). The pooled side effects from NK1-RAs did not significantly differ from previous reports and the toxicity rates in patients less than eighteen years old also did not diff between the two groups (P=0.497). However, we found that constipation and insomnia were more common in the patients of control groups, whereas diarrhea and hiccups were more frequently detected in patients receiving NK1-RAs. CONCLUSIONS: NK1-RAs improved the CR rate of CINV. They are effective for both adults and children. The use of NK1-RAs might be associated with the appearance of diarrhea and hiccups, while decreasing the possibility of constipation and insomnia.			2016				9998
Comparative efficacy and safety of axitinib versus sorafenib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Wang, H., Man, L., Li, G., Huang, G. and Wang, J.				oncotargets and therapy	oncotargets and therapy	OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of axitinib and sorafenib in the therapy of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible studies were searched from PubMed, Embase, and Future Medicine databases. The pooled hazard ratios and relative risk ratios (RRs) were calculated by using Stata 12.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 1,011 patients qualified to participate in this Phase III study that included randomized controlled trials. Meta-analysis results showed that axitinib was more highly and significantly associated with a survival benefit in the independently assessed progression-free survival in comparison to sorafenib. The values of RR of the objective response rate and disease control rate were also significantly different. Results of the analysis of adverse events concerning hypertension and hypothyroidism demonstrated that the values of RR were significantly higher in the axitinib group and lower risks were established in the patients treated with axitinib. CONCLUSION: Therefore, axitinib was a better treatment option for metastatic renal cell carcinoma treatment than sorafenib, especially after failure of prior systemic therapies. This analysis revealed that axitinib had higher risks of hypertension and hypothyroidism and lower risks of rash and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.			2016				9421
The Use of Arteriovenous Fistulae as an Adjunct to Peripheral Arterial Bypass: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Aherne, T., Kheirelseid, E., O'Neill, D., Bashar, K., Cullen, P., Whitford, D. and Naughton, P.				european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial bypass is an effective procedure for the management of patients with critical limb ischaemia. However, it is commonly associated with high rates of graft occlusion and subsequent limb loss. This is particularly apparent when the distal anastomosis is to the below-knee arterial segment. A number of studies have suggested that an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) sited at the distal anastomosis may reduce afterload, improve graft patency, and boost subsequent limb salvage. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of adjuvant AVF on the outcomes of peripheral arterial bypass. METHODS: The following databases were searched up to May 2015: Medline through Pubmed; the Cochrane Library; EMBASE; and reference lists of articles. STUDY ELIGIBILITY: All randomised controlled and observational studies that assessed the role of AVF as an adjunct to peripheral arterial bypass were included. Studies were required to include at least one pre-defined outcome. Data were extracted and assessed by two reviewers with any disagreements adjudicated on by the senior author. Pooled risk ratios were calculated using a random effects model. Additional subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: Two randomised controlled trials and seven retrospective cohort studies comprising 966 participants were included. Pooled standardized data showed no difference in primary graft patency (pooled RR = 1.25, 95% CI 0.73-2.16), secondary patency (pooled RR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.82-1.66), or limb salvage at 12-months (pooled RR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.80-1.60) for the peripheral bypass with AVF group compared with peripheral bypass alone. Subgroup analysis indicated a reduction in reintervention rates associated with AVF when performed in conjunction with a synthetic graft (pooled RR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.30-0.98). CONCLUSION: Although adjuvant AVF is not associated with additional operative complication there is little evidence to support its use. The evidence assessing its merits is weakened by small, retrospective studies with heterogeneous cohorts.			2016				9449
Treatment effectiveness and fidelity of manual therapy to the knee: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Salamh, P., Cook, C., Reiman, M. P. and Sheets, C.				musculoskeletal care	musculoskeletal care	Manual therapy (MT) is a commonly used treatment for knee osteoarthritis (OA) but to date only one systematic review has explored its effectiveness. The purpos e of the present study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature, to determine the effectiveness and fidelity of studies using MT techniques in individuals with knee OA. Relevant studies were assessed for inclusion. Effectiveness was measured using effect sizes, and methodological bias and treatment fidelity were both explored. Effect sizes were calculated using standardized mean differences (SMD) based on pooled data depending on statistical and clinical heterogeneity, as well as risk of bias. The search captured 2,969 studies; after screening, 12 were included. Four had a low risk of bias and high treatment fidelity. For self-reported function, comparing MT with no treatment resulted in a large effect size (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.84), as did adding MT to a comparator treatment (SMD 0.78). A significant difference was found for pain when adding MT to a comparator treatment (SMD 0.73). The findings in the present meta-analytical review support the use of MT versus a number of different comparators for improvement in self-reported knee function.

Palliative Care Interventions for Patients with Heart Failure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Diop, M. S., Rudolph, J. L., Zimmerman, K. M., Richter, M. A. and Skarf, L. M.				journal of palliative medicine	journal of palliative medicine	OBJECTIVE: To systematically characterize interventions and effectiveness of palliative care for advanced heart failure (HF) patients. BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced heart failure experience a high burden of distressing symptoms and diminished quality of life. Palliative care expertise with symptom management and healthcare decision-making benefits HF patients. METHODS: A systematic PubMed search was conducted from inception to June 2016 for studies of palliative care interventions for HF patients. Studies of humans with a HF diagnosis who underwent a palliative care intervention were included. Data were extracted on study design, participant characteristics, intervention components, and in three groups of outcomes: patient-centered outcomes, quality-of-death outcomes, and resource utilization. Study characteristics were examined to determine if meta-analysis was possible. RESULTS: The fifteen identified studies varied in design (prospective, n?=?10; retrospective, n?=?5). Studies enrolled older patients, but greater variability was found for race, sex, and marital status. A majority of studies measuring patient-centered outcomes demonstrated improvements including quality of life and satisfaction. Quality-of-death outcomes were mixed with a majority of studies reporting clarification of care preferences, but less improvement in death at home and hospice enrollment. A meta-analysis in three studies found that home-based palliative care consults in HF patients lower the risk of rehospitalization by 42% (RR?=?0.58; 95% Confidence Interval 0.44, 0.77). DISCUSSION: Available evidence suggests that home and team-based palliative interventions for HF patients improve patient-centered outcomes, documentation of preferences, and utilization. Increased high quality studies will aid the determination of the most effective palliative care approaches for the HF population.			2017				4887
Systematic review to evaluate the safety, efficacy and economical outcomes of the Vibrant Soundbridge for the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss		Bruchhage, K. L., Leichtle, A., Schönweiler, R., Todt, I., Baumgartner, W. D., Frenzel, H. and Wollenberg, B.				european archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the european federation of oto-rhino-laryngological societies (eufos) : affiliated with the german society for oto-rhino-laryngology - head and neck surgery	european archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the european federation of oto-rhino-laryngological societies (eufos) : affiliated with the german society for oto-rhino-laryngology - head and neck surgery	Introduced in the late 90s, the active middle ear implant Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) is nowadays used for hearing rehabilitation in patients with mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) unable to tolerate conventional hearing aids. In experienced hands, the surgical implantation is fast done, safe and highly standardized. Here, we present a systematic review, after more than 15 years of application, to determine the efficacy/effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, as well as patient satisfaction with the VSB active middle ear implant in the treatment of mild to severe SNHL. A systematic search of electronic databases, investigating the safety and effectiveness of the VSB in SNHL plus medical condition resulted in a total of 1640 papers. After removing duplicates, unrelated articles, screening against inclusion criteria and after in-depth screening, the number decreased to 37 articles. 13 articles were further excluded due to insufficient outcome data. 24 studies remained to be systematically reviewed. Data was searched on safety, efficacy and economical outcomes with the VSB. Safety-oriented outcomes included complication/adverse event rates, damage to the middle/inner ear, revision surgery/explant rate/device failure and mortality. Efficacy outcomes were divided into audiological outcomes, including hearing thresholds, functional gain, speech perception in quiet and noise, speech recognition thresholds, real ear insertion gain and subjective outcomes determined by questionnaires and patient-oriented scales. Data related to quality of life (QALY, ICER) were considered under economical outcomes. The VSB turns out to be a highly reliable and a safe device which significantly improves perception of speech in noisy situations with a high sound quality. In addition, the subjective benefit of the VSB was found to be mostly significant in all studies. Finally, implantation with the VSB proved to be a cost-effective and justified health care intervention.			2017				4701
Systematic review with meta-analysis: comparative efficacy of immunosuppressants and biologics for reducing hospitalisation and surgery in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis		Mao, E. J., Hazlewood, G. S., Kaplan, G. G., Peyrin-Biroulet, L. and Ananthakrishnan, A. N.				alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have a progressive course leading to hospitalisation and surgery. The ability of existing therapies to alter disease course is not clearly defined. AIM: To investigate the comparative efficacy of currently available inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapies to reduce hospitalisation and surgery. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review in MEDLINE/PubMed for randomised controlled trials (RCT) published between January 1980 and May 2016 examining efficacy of biological or immunomodulator therapy in IBD. We performed direct comparisons of pooled proportions of hospitalisation and surgery. Pair-wise comparisons using a random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis were performed to assess comparative efficacy of different treatments. RESULTS: We identified seven randomised controlled trials (5 CD; 2 UC) comparing three biologics and one immunomodulator with placebo. In CD, anti-TNF biologics significantly reduced hospitalisation [Odds ratio (OR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.60] and surgery (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.13-0.42) compared to placebo. No statistically significant reduction was noted with azathioprine or vedolizumab. Azathioprine was inferior to both infliximab and adalimumab in preventing CD-related hospitalisation (>97.5% probability). Anti-TNF biologics significantly reduced hospitalisation (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29-0.80) and surgery (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.97) in UC. There were no statistically significant differences in the pair-wise comparisons between active treatments. CONCLUSIONS: In CD and UC, anti-TNF biologics are efficacious in reducing the odds of hospitalisation by half and surgery by 33-77%. Azathioprine and vedolizumab were not associated with a similar improvement, but robust conclusions may be limited due to paucity of RCTs.			2017				4735
Adjacent segment disease requiring reoperation in cervical total disc arthroplasty: A literature review and update		Chang, K. E., Pham, M. H. and Hsieh, P. C.				journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the neurosurgical society of australasia	journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the neurosurgical society of australasia	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the difference in rate of reoperation for adjacent segment disease (ASD) between anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) and total disc replacement (TDR). METHOD: A systematic review of literature was performed using PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, and various other search engines. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were used to report an estimated overall rate of reoperation secondary to ASD for both ACDF and TDR. RESULTS: Forty-six clinical trials were identified after the initial search, and 9 studies met our inclusion criteria. Although the data was not pooled due to significant variation in level of evidence and length of follow-up, the overall rate of reoperation for ASD in the TDR cohort of patients analyzed in our review was 3.1% (range: 0-7.1%) with a follow-up between 24 and 80months. In contrast, the reoperation rate for ASD in the ACDF control was 6.0% (range: 1.0-11.9%). CONCLUSION: The average reoperation rate for ASD was 3.1% for the TDR across all studies, which was lower than the reoperation rate of 6.0% in the ACDF group. Further studies and follow-up data are still needed to determine if cervical TDR preserves adjacent segment motion more efficiently than the natural history of the disease, and if it will be a durable option when compared to the already excellent results of ACDF.			2017				5167
Sentinel Lymph Node Assessment in Endometrial Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Smith, A. J., Fader, A. N. and Tanner, E. J.				american journal of obstetrics and gynecology	american journal of obstetrics and gynecology	BACKGROUND: In the staging of endometrial cancer, controversy remains regarding the role of sentinel lymph node mapping compared with other nodal assessment strategies. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact of sentinel lymph node mapping in the management of endometrial cancer. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled trials for studies published in English before March 25, 2016 (PROSPERO CRD42016036503). STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were included if they contained 10 or more women with endometrial cancer and reported on detection rate, sensitivity, and/or impact on treatment or survival of sentinel lymph node mapping. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Two authors independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles for inclusion and assessed study quality. The detection rate, sensitivity, and factors associated with successful mapping (study size, body mass index, tumor histology and grade, injection site, dye type) were synthesized through random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression. RESULTS: We identified 55 eligible studies, which included 4,915 women. The overall detection rate of sentinel lymph node mapping was 81% (95% CI 77-84) with a 50% (95% CI 44-56) bilateral pelvic node detection rate and 17% (95% CI 11-23) para-aortic detection rate. There was no difference in detection rates by patient body mass index or tumor histology and grade. Use of indocyanine green increased the bilateral detection rate compared with blue dye. Additionally, cervical injection increased the bilateral SLN detection rate but decreased the para-aortic detection rate compared with alternative injection techniques. Intraoperative sentinel lymph node frozen section increased the overall and bilateral detection rates. The sensitivity of sentinel node mapping to detect metastases was 96% (95% CI 91-98); ultrastaging did not improve sensitivity. Compared to women staged with complete lymphadenectomy, women staged with sentinel lymph node mapping were more likely to receive adjuvant treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel lymph node mapping is feasible and accurately predicts nodal status in women with endometrial cancer. The current data favors the use of cervical injection techniques with indocyanine green. Sentinel lymph mapping may be considered an alternative standard of care in the staging of women with endometrial cancer.			2017				4552
Drug Interactions between Hormonal Contraceptives and Psychotropic Drugs: A Systematic Review		Berry-Bibee, E. N., Kim, M. J., Simmons, K. B., Tepper, N. K., Riley, H. E., Pagano, H. P. and Curtis, K. M.				contraception	contraception	OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the co-administration of hormonal contraceptives (HC) and psychotropic drugs commonly used to treat anxiety and/or depression results in safety or efficacy concerns for either drug. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Cochrane libraries for clinical or pharmacokinetic [PK] studies that examined co-administration of any HC with psychotropic drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs], tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], oral benzodiazepines, bupropion, mirtazapine, trazadone, buspirone, hydroxyzine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], or atypical antipsychotics) in reproductive aged women. RESULTS: Of 555 articles identified, 22 articles (18 studies) met inclusion criteria. We identified five studies on SSRIs, four on TCAs, one on bupropion, three on atypical antipsychotics and five on oral benzodiazepines. No articles met inclusion criteria for SNRIs, mirtazapine, trazadone, buspirone, hydroxyzine or MAOIs. Overall, clinical studies did not demonstrate differences in unintended pregnancy rates when HCs were administered with and without psychotropic drugs or in psychotropic drug treatment outcomes when psychotropic drugs were administered with and without HCs. PK studies did not demonstrate changes in drug exposure related to contraceptive safety, contraceptive effectiveness or psychotropic drug effectiveness for most classes of psychotropic drugs. However, limited PK data raise concern for HCs increasing systemic exposure of amitriptyline and imipramine (both TCAs), theoretically posing safety concerns. CONCLUSION: Limited quality and quantity evidence on use of psychotropic drugs and HCs suggests low concern for clinically significant interactions, though no data exist specifically for non-oral formulations of HC. Given the high frequency of use for both HCs and psychotropic drugs among reproductive age women in the US, this review highlights a need for further research in this area.			2016				9019
A systematic review of randomised controlled trials examining the therapeutic effects of adult bone marrow-derived stem cells for non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy		Lu, Y., Wang, Y., Lin, M., Zhou, J., Wang, Z., Jiang, M. and He, B.				stem cell research & therapy	stem cell research & therapy	BACKGROUND: Certain early-phase clinical trials have suggested that bone marrow-derived stem cell transplantation might improve left ventricular function in patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM), whereas others trials have revealed no benefit from this approach. We sought to evaluate the therapeutic effects of bone marrow-derived stem cell therapy on NIDCM. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases (through February 2016) for randomised controlled clinical trials that reported on bone marrow-derived stem cell transplantation for patients with NIDCM with a follow-up period ?12 months. The co-primary endpoints were changes in mortality rate and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); the secondary endpoints were changes in the 6-minute-walk test (6MWT) and left ventricular chamber size. Seven trials involving bone marrow-derived stem cell therapy that included 482 patients satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Subjects who received bone marrow-derived stem cell therapy exhibited a significant reduction in mortality rate (19.7% in the cell group vs. 27.1% in the control group; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.16 to -0.00, I (2)?=?52%, p?=?0.04). Bone marrow-derived stem cell therapy tended to produce LVEF improvement within 6 months (1.83% increase; 95% CI -0.27 to 3.94, I (2)?=?74%, p?=?0.09) and significantly improved LVEF after mid-term (6-12 months) follow-up (3.53% increase; 95% CI 0.76 to 6.29, I (2)?=?88%, p?=?0.01). However, this therapy produced no significant benefit in the 6MWT (p?=?0.18). Finally, the transplantation of increased numbers of stem cells resulted in no observable additional benefit with respect to LVEF. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow-derived stem cell therapy might have improved prognoses and appeared to provide moderate benefits in cardiac systolic function at mid-term follow-up. However, this therapy produced no observed improvement in exercise tolerance.			2016				9921
A systematic review of the effectiveness of simulation-based education on satisfaction and learning outcomes in nurse practitioner programs		Warren, J. N., Luctkar-Flude, M., Godfrey, C. and Lukewich, J.				nurse education today	nurse education today	BACKGROUND: High-fidelity simulation (HFS) is becoming an integral component in healthcare education programs. There is considerable evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of HFS on satisfaction and learning outcomes within undergraduate nursing programs; however, there are few studies that have investigated its use and effectiveness within nurse practitioner (NP) programs. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the best available evidence about the effectiveness of HFS within NP education programs worldwide. The specific review question was: what is the effect of HFS on learner satisfaction, knowledge, attitudes, and skill performance in NP education? METHODS: Joanna Briggs Institute systematic review methodology was utilized. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, PROSPERO, HealthSTAR, AMED, Cochrane, Global Health and PsycINFO. Studies were included if they were quantitative in nature and reported on any aspect HFS within a NP program. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the review. All studies were conducted in the United States and published between 2007 and 2014. Outcomes explored included: knowledge, attitudes, skills and satisfaction. The majority of studies compared HFS to online learning or traditional classroom lecture. Most study scenarios featured high acuity, low frequency events within acute care settings; only two studies utilized scenarios simulated within primary care. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence supporting the use of HFS within NP programs. In general, HFS increases students' knowledge and confidence, and students are more satisfied with simulation-based teaching in comparison to other methods. Future studies should explore the effectiveness of simulation training within NP programs in reducing the theory to practice gap, and evaluate knowledge retention, transferability to real patient situations, and impact of simulation on patient outcomes.			2016				7372
The effect of HIV counselling and testing on HIV acquisition in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review		Rosenberg, N. E., Hauser, B. M., Ryan, J. and Miller, W. C.				sexually transmitted infections	sexually transmitted infections	OBJECTIVES: Annually, millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) receive HIV counselling and testing (HCT), a service designed to inform persons of their HIV status and, if HIV uninfected, reduce HIV acquisition risk. However, the impact of HCT on HIV acquisition has not been systematically evaluated. We conducted a systematic review to assess this relationship in SSA. METHODS: We searched for articles from SSA meeting the following criteria: an HIV-uninfected population, HCT as an exposure, longitudinal design and an HIV acquisition endpoint. Three sets of comparisons were assessed and divided into strata: sites receiving HCT versus sites not receiving HCT (Strata A), persons receiving HCT versus persons not receiving HCT (Strata B) and persons receiving couple HCT (cHCT) versus persons receiving individual HCT (Strata C). RESULTS: We reviewed 1635 abstracts; eight met all inclusion criteria. Strata A consisted of one cluster randomised trial with a non-significant trend towards HCT being harmful: incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.4. Strata B consisted of five observational studies with non-significant unadjusted IRRs from 0.6 to 1.3. Strata C consisted of two studies. Both displayed trends towards cHCT being more protective than individual HCT (IRRs: 0.3-0.5). All studies had at least one design limitation. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of intensive scale-up of HCT in SSA, few well-designed studies have assessed the prevention impacts of HCT. The limited body of evidence suggests that individual HCT does not have a consistent impact on HIV acquisition, and cHCT is more protective than individual HCT.			2016				6553
Effects of Short-Term Exercise Interventions on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms in Patients with Dementia: A Systematic Review		Fleiner, T., Leucht, S., Foerstl, H., Zijlstra, W. and Haussermann, P.				journal of alzheimer's disease : jad	journal of alzheimer's disease : jad	Observational and interventional studies indicate a direct link between the patients' physical activity and the extent of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). At present, there are no evidence-based recommendations for physical exercise in the acute dementia care settings. Hence, this systematic review investigates the effects of short-term exercise trials on BPSD. Trials with a length up to three months investigating the effects of structured exercise interventions on BPSD in acute dementia care settings were included. Five trials, referring to a total of N?=?206 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The trial durations ranged from three up to twelve weeks. All trials conducted three sessions per week of 30 to 45 minutes. Three trials reported significant reductions of BPSD and differences in comparison to the pre-test and control groups. Out of the three trials investigating the effects of exercise interventions on depressive symptoms, one reported significant reduction and two reported no differences in pre-post analysis. Exercise represents a potentially worthwhile approach for the treatment of patients suffering from BPSD. Given the scarcity of available studies, more randomized controlled short-term exercise trials in acute dementia care settings are needed to define appropriate exercise recommendations for clinicians treating these patients.			2017				4636
Systematic review: outcomes and post-operative complications following colectomy for ulcerative colitis		Peyrin-Biroulet, L., Germain, A., Patel, A. S. and Lindsay, J. O.				alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	BACKGROUND: Colectomy for ulcerative colitis is associated with short- and long-term complications. Estimates of the frequency of such complications are variable and may have changed since the introduction of biological therapy. Understanding the true burden of surgical complications is important to clinicians in assessing risks and benefits of colectomy vs. continued medical therapy. AIM: To ascertain the outcomes of colectomy and ileal pouch surgery in patients with ulcerative colitis in the biologics era. METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library were searched for studies (2002-2015) reporting the outcomes of colorectal procedures (total and subtotal colectomy, IPAA with J-, S-, W-pouch) in adults with ulcerative colitis. Conferences proceedings (2011-2015) were hand-searched. RESULTS: We identified 28 studies (20,801 patients) reporting outcomes from procedures conducted from 2002-2015. Early complications (?30 days post-operatively), reported in 10 studies, occurred in 9-65% of patients with ulcerative colitis; late complications (>30 days post-operatively) occurred in 17-55% of patients. Most frequent short-term complications: infectious complications and ileus (mean incidence 20% and 18%). Most frequent long-term complications: pouchitis, faecal incontinence and small bowel obstruction (mean incidence 29%, 21% and 17%). Rates of early infection and late pouch failure decreased from 22% and 13% in 2002-2009 to 11% and 2% in 2010-2015. The mean incidence of post-operative mortality was 1.0% across 11 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Early and late complications arise in about a third of patients undergoing surgery for ulcerative colitis. While colorectal surgical procedures are recommended for a specific group of patients, the post-operative complications associated with these procedures should not be underestimated.			2016				8630
Systematic review of the use of endo-luminal topical negative pressure in oesophageal leaks and perforations		Newton, N. J., Sharrock, A., Rickard, R. and Mughal, M.				diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the international society for diseases of the esophagus / i.s.d.e	diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the international society for diseases of the esophagus / i.s.d.e	Topical negative pressure is widely used in the management of superficial wounds. The use of this technology in the management of oesophageal perforations is becoming increasingly common. This systematic review aims to capture available evidence about its use in this setting. Medline and Embase were searched using MeSH terms and free text: esophageal perforation; esophageal injury; vacuum assisted closure; vacuum therapy device; esophagus; wounds penetrating; esophageal perforation; wound healing; negative pressure wound therapy. Searches were carried out between April and November 2015. Case series, cohort trials and controlled trials were included. Additional studies were found by hand searching reference lists. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria with 180 patients. Nine of the studies were case series and two were retrospective comparisons of negative pressure with stents or clips. Healing of the perforation occurred in 163/179 patients and the overall mortality was 12.8%. Compared with published data on mortality from oesophageal perforation, the application of negative pressure appears to be beneficial. The studies are, however, limited to case series and retrospective cohort studies. The number of patients in each study is small and in the absence of randomized trials demonstrating a lack of bias firm conclusions cannot be made.			2017				4430
The Influence of Evidence-Based Surgical Indications and Techniques on Failure Rates After Arthroscopic Shoulder Stabilization in the Contact or Collision Athlete With Anterior Shoulder Instability		Leroux, T. S., Saltzman, B. M., Meyer, M., Frank, R. M., Bach, B. R., Cole, B. J., Romeo, A. A. and Verma, N. N.				the american journal of sports medicine	the american journal of sports medicine	BACKGROUND: It has been reported that arthroscopic shoulder stabilization yields higher rates of failure in contact or collision athletes as compared with open shoulder stabilization; however, this is largely based upon studies that do not employ modern, evidence-based surgical indications and techniques for arthroscopic shoulder stabilization. PURPOSE: To (1) determine the pooled failure rate across all studies reporting failure after primary arthroscopic shoulder stabilization for anterior shoulder instability in contact or collision athletes and (2) stratify failure rates according to studies that use evidence-based surgical indications and techniques. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A review of PubMed, Medline, and Embase was performed to identify all clinical studies with a minimum of 1-year follow-up that reported failure rates after arthroscopic shoulder stabilization for anterior shoulder instability in contact or collision athletes. Data pertaining to patient demographics, clinical and radiographic preoperative assessment, surgical indications, surgical technique, rehabilitation, and outcome were collected from each included study. An overall failure rate was determined across all included studies. After this, a secondary literature review was performed to identify factors related to patient selection and surgical technique that significantly influence failure after primary arthroscopic shoulder stabilization. Failure rates were then determined among included studies that used these evidence-based indications and techniques. RESULTS: Overall, 26 studies reporting on 779 contact or collision athletes met the inclusion criteria. The mean patient age was 19.9 years, 90.3% were male, and the most common sport was rugby. There was considerable variability in the reporting of patient demographics, preoperative assessment, surgical indications, surgical technique, and patient outcomes. Across all included studies, the pooled failure rate after arthroscopic shoulder stabilization in the contact or collision athlete was 17.8%; however, among studies that excluded patients with significant bone loss, used a minimum of 3 suture anchors, and performed the stabilization in the lateral decubitus position, the failure rate was 7.9%. CONCLUSION: The rate of failure after arthroscopic shoulder stabilization in contact or collision athletes decreases from 17.8% to 7.9% after the use of evidence-based surgical indications and techniques.			2017				5238
Systematic review of published phase 3 data on anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies in patients with hypercholesterolaemia		Gouni-Berthold, I., Descamps, O. S., Fraass, U., Hartfield, E., Allcott, K., Dent, R. and März, W.				british journal of clinical pharmacology	british journal of clinical pharmacology	AIMS: Two anti-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies, alirocumab and evolocumab, have been approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in certain patients. We reviewed data from phase 3 studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these antibodies. METHODS: We systematically reviewed phase 3 English-language studies in patients with hypercholesterolaemia, published between 1 January 2005 and 20 October 2015. Congress proceedings from 16 November 2012 to 16 November 2015 were also reviewed. RESULTS: We identified 12 studies of alirocumab and nine of evolocumab, including over 10 000 patients overall. Most studies enrolled patients with hypercholesterolaemia and used anti-PCSK9 antibodies with statins. The ODYSSEY FH I, FH II and HIGH FH alirocumab studies and the RUTHERFORD-2 evolocumab study exclusively recruited patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Two evolocumab studies focused mainly on homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH): TESLA Part B and TAUSSIG (a TESLA sub-study); only data for HoFH are reported here. All comparator studies demonstrated a reduction in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) with the anti-PCSK9 antibodies. No head to head studies were conducted between alirocumab and evolocumab. Up to 87% of patients receiving alirocumab and up to 98% receiving evolocumab reached LDL-C goals. Both antibodies were effective and well tolerated across a broad population of patients and in specific subgroups, such as those with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Using anti-PCSK9 antibodies as add-on therapy to other lipid-lowering treatments or as monotherapy for patients unable to tolerate statins may help patients with high cardiovascular risk to achieve their LDL-C goals.			2016				8719
Intratympanic dexamethasone in sudden sensorineural hearing loss: A systematic review and meta-analysis		El Sabbagh, N. G., Sewitch, M. J., Bezdjian, A. and Daniel, S. J.				the laryngoscope	the laryngoscope	OBJECTIVE: Systemic dexamethasone has demonstrated conclusive benefits in reversing sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) despite considerable number of potential side effects. In contrast, the intratympanic route of steroid administration averts several possible complications. This study aims to examine the literature to delineate the efficacy and side effect of intratympanic dexamethasone (ITD) injection for the treatment of SSNHL. DATA SOURCE: Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE electronic databases from January 1950 to August 2014, with an update performed on November 10, 2014. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCCTs), using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram and guidelines. Quality assessment was performed using The Cochrane Collaboration Tool for Assessing Risk of Bias. RESULTS: Eight RCCTs on SSNHL were included Three of the eight studies had high risk of bias. Substantial heterogeneity was found. The meta-analysis failed to detect statistically significant difference between ITD and alternative treatment (odds ratio = 0.39, 95% credible intervals = 0.11-1.27). The side-effects profile was favorable for ITD. No serious adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSION: There is no sufficient scientific evidence to support a difference between ITD and alternative therapy for SSNHL. We recommend larger RCCTs to determine the effectiveness of ITD compared to oral steroid therapy. We encourage a shift in study design selection toward noninferiority or superiority studies. Avoiding systemic corticotherapy, especially in vulnerable populations, should be the rationale for future research in the field. Laryngoscope, 2016.			2017				4271
Marginal bone loss around dental implants with and without microthreads in the neck: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Niu, W., Wang, P., Zhu, S., Liu, Z. and Ji, P.				the journal of prosthetic dentistry	the journal of prosthetic dentistry	STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Whether microthreads in the crestal portion can reduce the amount of marginal bone loss (MBL) around implants has not yet been determined. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the marginal bone loss around dental implants with and without microthreads in the neck. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review was based on the PRISMA guidelines. An electronic search with no restrictions on language was performed from inception to August 19, 2015, in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, and AMED (Ovid) databases. A manual search was also performed. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared the MBL between implants with and without microthreads in the neck were included. Qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis were performed. MBL was measured by using the mean difference (MD). Review Manager v5.3 software was used for meta-analysis (?=.05). RESULTS: Five articles were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 3 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Four studies found that a microthread design can significantly reduce MBL under functional loading, whereas 1 study found no signi?cant difference. The homogeneity test of meta-analysis confirmed acceptable heterogeneity among the 3 studies (I(2)=0.49). A random-effects model was used. The result shows that MBL around implants with microthread design can be reduced signi?cantly (P=.030; MD: -0.09; CI: -0.18 to -0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis showed that microthread design in the implant neck can reduce the amount of MBL; however, RCTs included in the review were few and the difference was small. In clinical practice, an implant with a roughened surface and microthreaded neck could be selected to maintain bone level.			2017				4574
Risk of severe rash in cancer patients treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Zhang, X., Ran, Y. G. and Wang, K. J.				future oncology (london, england)	future oncology (london, england)	AIM: We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of severe rash associated with the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and oncology conference proceedings were searched for articles published till March 2016. RESULTS: A total of 18,309 patients from 37 randomized controlled trials were available for the meta-analysis. The overall incidence for severe rash was 6.6% (95% CI: 5.2-8.3%) among patients receiving EGFR-TKIs. The use of EGFR-TKIs significantly increased the risk of developing severe rash (risk ratio: 7.70; 95% CI: 5.79-10.23) in cancer patients. On subgroup analysis, the increased risk of severe rash was driven predominantly by drug type (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: EGFR-TKIs significantly increase the risk of developing severe rash in cancer patients.			2016				9686
Positive effects of resistant starch supplementation on bowel function in healthy adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials		Shen, D., Bai, H., Li, Z., Yu, Y., Zhang, H. and Chen, L.				international journal of food sciences and nutrition	international journal of food sciences and nutrition	Animal experimental studies have found that resistant starch can significantly improve bowel function, but the outcomes are mixed while conducting human studies. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the relationship between resistant starch supplementation and large intestinal function. Three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus) were searched to identify eligible studies. The standardized mean difference (SMD) or weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated using a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model. The pooled findings revealed that resistant starch significantly increased fecal wet weight (WMD 35.51?g/d, 95% CI 1.21, 69.82) and butyrate concentration (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.32, 0.89). Also, it significantly reduced fecal PH (WMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.35, -0.03), but the increment of defecation frequency were not statistically significant (WMD 0.04stools/g, 95% CI -0.08, 0.16). To conclude, our study found that resistant starch elicited a beneficial effect on the function of large bowel in healthy adults.[Formula: see text].			2017				4720
Intravenous immunoglobulins for refractory status epilepticus, part I: A scoping systematic review of the adult literature		Zeiler, F. A., Matuszczak, M., Teitelbaum, J., Kazina, C. J. and Gillman, L. M.				seizure	seizure	PURPOSE: Our goal was to perform a scoping systematic review of the literature on the use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) for refractory status epilepticus (RSE) in adults. METHOD: Articles from MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, Healthstar, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, clinicaltrials.gov (inception to May 2016), reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature were searched. The strength of evidence was adjudicated using both the Oxford and GRADE methodology by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Twenty-four original articles were identified. A total of 33 adult patients were described as receiving IVIG for RSE. Seizure reduction/control with IVIG occurred in 15 of the 33 patients (45.4%), with 1 (3.0%) and 14 (42.4%) displaying partial and complete responses respectively. No adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSION: Oxford level 4, GRADE D evidence exists to suggest an unclear impact of IVIG therapy in adult RSE. Routine use of IVIG in adult RSE cannot be recommended at this time.			2017				4306
Prenatal Intake of Vitamins and Allergic Outcomes in the Offspring: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Vahdaninia, M., Mackenzie, H., Helps, S. and Dean, T.				the journal of allergy and clinical immunology. in practice	the journal of allergy and clinical immunology. in practice	BACKGROUND: Allergic diseases have seen a rise worldwide, with children suffering the highest burden. Thus, early prevention of allergic diseases is a public health priority. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of vitamin interventions during pregnancy on developing allergic diseases in offspring. METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registration, E-theses, and Web of Science. Study quality was evaluated using Cochrane's risk of bias tool. Included RCTs had a minimum of 1-month follow-up postgestation. RESULTS: A total of 5 RCTs met the inclusion criteria, including 2456 children who used vitamins C + E (1 study), vitamin C (1 study), and vitamin D (3 studies) compared with placebo/control. Two studies were judged to have a high risk of bias for performance bias or a high rate of loss to follow-up. All were rated as low risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessment. We did not perform meta-analysis with vitamin C or vitamin C + E studies due to high heterogeneity between the 2 included studies. However, we did conduct a meta-analysis with trials on vitamin D (including 1493 children) and the results showed an association between the prenatal intake of vitamin D and the risk of developing recurrent wheeze in offspring (relative risk (RR), 0.812; 95% CI, 0.67-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence suggests that prenatal supplementation of vitamin D might have a beneficial effect on recurrent wheezing in children. Longer-term follow-up of these studies is needed to ascertain whether this observed effect is sustained. There is lack of evidence on the effect of other vitamins for the prevention of respiratory and/or allergic outcomes.			2017				4861
Antibiotic prophylaxis and its appropriate timing for urological surgical procedures in patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria: A systematic review		Ramos, J. A., Salinas, D. F., Osorio, J. and Ruano-Ravina, A.				arab journal of urology	arab journal of urology	OBJECTIVE: To review the existing literature on when and how to treat patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) who undergo urological surgery, as uncertainty about this issue persists. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to compare the different timing of administration of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with AB undergoing urological surgery. We used predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and we also developed a specific quality scale to assess the quality of the papers included. RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Of the nine studies included, eight evaluated antibiotic prophylaxis regardless of the presence of AB, as their purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for urological procedures. Of these, four studies showed a significant reduction in the rate of infections in the intervention group compared with placebo, or with the same antibiotic therapy but using different durations of therapy. Four studies found no significant differences in infectious complications between the intervention and comparison arms. Only one study assessed the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with AB. CONCLUSIONS: With the available evidence, antibiotic therapy should be considered only for procedures in which studies have shown a clinical benefit in the prevention of infection. It is important to establish the duration and type of treatment for antimicrobial therapy for surgical prophylaxis in patients with AB who are going to receive urological invasive procedures.			2016				7304
Review of 103 Cases of Laparoscopic Repeat Liver Resection for Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma		Goh, B. K., Teo, J. Y., Chan, C. Y., Lee, S. Y., Cheow, P. C. and Chung, A. Y.				journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques. part a	journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques. part a	INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic repeat liver resection (LRLR) has been shown in small retrospective studies to be a safe and effective treatment for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (rHCC) in selected patients. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the current literature to determine the safety, feasibility, and oncologic integrity of LRLR for rHCC. METHODS: A computerized search of the PubMed database was performed for all English language studies evaluating LRLR for HCC from January 1, 2005 to March 31, 2016. RESULTS: Ten studies reporting on 103 patients were included in this review. 30/51 (58.5%) patients had liver cirrhosis. In 66/95 (69.5%) patients, the index surgery was an open resection and this was a major hepatectomy in 8/49 (16.3%) patients. In 17/72 (23.6%) patients, LRLR was performed for tumors in the posterosuperior segments and in 21/60 (35%) for ipsilateral HCC recurrence. The median tumor size of rHCC ranged from 17-40?mm and 8/69 (11.6%) LRLR were for multifocal rHCC. In 100/103 (97%) patients LRLR was attempted via pure laparoscopy and 2 (1.9%) required open conversion. Median operation time of LRLR ranged from 73-343 minutes and the median blood loss ranged from 50 to 297?mL. The reported postoperative morbidity was 24/97 (24.7%) and there was no postoperative mortality. The median postoperative length of stay ranged from 3.5 to 11 days. Three studies compared the outcomes of LRLR versus open resection for rHCC and all three demonstrated a significant decrease in blood loss in favor of LRLR. CONCLUSION: In highly selected patients; LRLR for rHCC is feasible and safe. LRLR can be performed for patients with previous open LR, previous major hepatectomy, two previous LR, multiple tumors, liver cirrhosis, ipsilateral HCC recurrence, and cancers located in the difficult posterosuperior segments. Comparative studies have demonstrated that LRLR is superior to open repeat liver resection in terms of perioperative outcomes such as decreased blood loss and length of stay.			2016				10560
Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on Wenxin keli		Wang, X., Wang, Y., Feng, X., Lu, Y., Zhang, Y., Wang, W. and Zhu, W.				drug design, development and therapy	drug design, development and therapy	"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and cost associated with Wenxin keli in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases based on meta-analysis. METHODS: The terms ""Wenxin keli"" and ""Wenxin"" were used as the search terms in the PubMed, ProQuest, Springer, the Cochrane Library, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP (Chinese Scientific Journals Database), and Wan fang electronic databases (from January 2000 to October 2015). Relevant print journals and conference papers were also searched. Studies on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Wenxin keli used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases were screened, and its indications were classified. Meta-analysis of these studies was conducted using the RevMan 5.2 software. RESULTS: A total of 49 RCTs (n=4,610) were included, 29 of which focused on arrhythmia, seven on angina, seven on heart failure, two on viral myocarditis, and four on menopausal syndrome. Analysis of the therapeutic indications of Wenxin keli showed that it was comparatively more curative and effective than other available treatments for cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSION: Wenxin keli showed better clinical efficacy in the treatment of arrhythmia, angina, and heart failure; however, more high-quality evidence is needed to support its use in the clinical setting."			2016				8916
Standard versus Rotation Technique for Insertion of Supraglottic Airway Devices: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Park, J. H., Lee, J. S., Nam, S. B., Ju, J. W. and Kim, M. S.				yonsei medical journal	yonsei medical journal	PURPOSE: Supraglottic airway devices have been widely utilized as an alternative to tracheal intubation in various clinical situations. The rotation technique has been proposed to improve the insertion success rate of supraglottic airways. However, the clinical efficacy of this technique remains uncertain as previous results have been inconsistent, depending on the variable evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in April 2015 for randomized controlled trials that compared the rotation and standard techniques for inserting supraglottic airways. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials (1505 patients, 753 with the rotation technique) were included. The success rate at the first attempt was significantly higher with the rotation technique than with the standard technique [relative risk (RR): 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05 to 1.23; p=0.002]. The rotation technique provided significantly higher overall success rates (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.09; p<0.001). Device insertion was completed faster with the rotation technique (mean difference: -4.6 seconds; 95% CI: -7.37 to -1.74; p=0.002). The incidence of blood staining on the removed device (RR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.47; p<0.001) was significantly lower with the rotation technique. CONCLUSION: The rotation technique provided higher first-attempt and overall success rates, faster insertion, and a lower incidence of blood on the removed device, reflecting less mucosal trauma. Thus, it may be considered as an alternative to the standard technique when predicting or encountering difficulty in inserting supraglottic airways.			2016				8544
Effect of exercise training on sleep apnea: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Aiello, K. D., Caughey, W. G., Nelluri, B., Sharma, A., Mookadam, F. and Mookadam, M.				respiratory medicine	respiratory medicine	INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is difficult to manage for those who are intolerant or noncompliant with standard facial mask treatment options. Current treatment options do not address the underlying cause of OSA. Exercise as a treatment option has been found to improve OSA indices. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of exercise on apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) in adult patients with OSA via a systematic review and meta-analysis. Additional objectives included evaluation of other indices of OSA and well-being in patients after completing an exercise regimen. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Web of Science, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched based on a priori criteria of all studies evaluating the effect of an exercise program on various sleep apnea indices. Both PRISMA statement and MOOSE consensus statement were adhered to. Eight Articles (182 participants) were included: a meta-analysis using a random effects model showed, a decrease in AHI (unstandardized mean difference [USMD], -0.536, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.865 to -0.206, I(2), 20%), reduced Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) (USMD, -1.246, 95% CI, -2.397 to -0.0953, I(2), 0%), and lower body mass index (BMI) (USMD, -0.0473, 95% CI, -0.0375 to 0.280, I(2), 0%), in patients receiving exercise as treatment. Relative risks (RR) and odds ratios (OR) showed decreases in AHI (OR: 72.33, 95% CI, 27.906 to 187.491, RR: 7.294, 95% CI, 4.072 to 13.065) in patients receiving exercise as treatment. CONCLUSION: Among adult patients with OSA, exercise as the sole intervention was associated with improved clinical outcomes.			2016				6897
Systematic review with meta-analysis: fundic gland polyps and proton pump inhibitors		Martin, F. C., Chenevix-Trench, G. and Yeomans, N. D.				alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	BACKGROUND: A causal association between proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and fundic gland polyps has been suggested, but the data are conflicting. AIM: To clarify the relationship through a meta-analysis of the existing data. METHODS: A systematic retrieval and selection of records was performed. The main inclusion criteria were original studies reporting the prevalence of fundic gland polyps in PPI users or the reverse, compared to controls. Key outcomes were the odds ratios (OR) for fundic gland polyp prevalence in association with PPI use, prevalence of PPI use amongst subjects with fundic gland polyps and fundic gland polyp prevalence among PPI users. Statistical analysis was performed using Mix 2.0 Pro. RESULTS: The initial search using electronic databases and manual searching retrieved 339 peer-reviewed articles and abstracts. Twenty articles met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a total of 40 218 subjects included. The meta-analysis of 12 studies revealed an increase in fundic gland polyps amongst PPI users compared to controls (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.42-4.27, P = 0.001), particularly among individuals taking PPIs for at least 6 months (OR: 4.71, 95% CI 2.22-9.99, P < 0.001) or 12 months (OR: 5.32, 95% CI 2.58-10.99, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Proton pump inhibitor usage is associated with a significantly increased prevalence of fundic gland polyps, and there is a trend for this to increase with longer length of PPI exposure. However, the meta-analysis is limited mainly to cohort studies.			2016				8925
The relationship between time to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy and survival in breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Raphael, M. J., Biagi, J. J., Kong, W., Mates, M., Booth, C. M. and Mackillop, W. J.				breast cancer research and treatment	breast cancer research and treatment	BACKGROUND: It is known that adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in women with breast cancer. It is not known whether the interval between surgery and the initiation of chemotherapy influences its effectiveness. PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between time to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy and survival in women with breast cancer, through a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis. METHODS: Systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, and abstracts presented at major international oncology conferences. The primary meta-analysis included only high-validity studies which directly measured the time from surgery to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy and which controlled for major prognostic factors. Outcomes reported in the original studies were converted to a regression coefficient (?) and standard error corresponding to a 4-week delay in the initiation of chemotherapy. These relative risks were combined in both fixed- and random-effects models. Homogeneity was assessed by the Cochran ? (2) statistic and the I (2) statistic. Potential publication bias was investigated using standard error-based funnel plots. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of 8 high-validity studies demonstrated that a 4-week increase in TTAC was associated with a significant increase in the risk of death in both the fixed-effects model (RR 1.04; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.08) and random-effects model (RR 1.08; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.15). The association remained significant when the most highly weighted studies were sequentially removed from this analysis, and also when additional, lower validity studies were included in this analysis. Funnel plots showed no significant asymmetry to suggest publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Increased waiting time from surgery to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with a significant decrease in survival. Avoidance of unnecessary delays in the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy has the potential to save the lives of many women with breast cancer.			2016				7113
The Interdisciplinary Rehabilitation Care Team and the Role of Physical Therapy in Survivor Exercise		McNeely, M. L., Dolgoy, N., Onazi, M. and Suderman, K.				clinical journal of oncology nursing	clinical journal of oncology nursing	BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation professionals offer expertise in functional assessment, treatment of impairments and functional limitations, and disability prevention. To optimize recovery, and often prior to participating in community-based exercise programming, survivors may need rehabilitation services from a range of healthcare professionals, including physiatrists, nurses, nutritionists, psychologists, and speech, occupational, and physical therapists. OBJECTIVES: Survivors with physical impairments and functional limitations may benefit from interdisciplinary rehabilitation and physical therapy, including tailored therapeutic exercise interventions. METHODS: A literature review was conducted using the key words cancer survivor, cancer rehabilitation, impairment, fatigue, lymphedema, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and exercise. MEDLINE®, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL® databases were searched. FINDINGS: Nurses play a critical role in identifying survivors whose function or fitness is compromised to the point where participation in community-based exercise programming would be inappropriate or unsafe. The interdisciplinary rehabilitation care team can help facilitate the survivor's transition to community-based exercise programming.			2016				10331
Neurological Functional Outcomes of Decompressive Hemicraniectomy versus Conventional Treatment for Malignant Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction: a Systematic Review and Mata-Analysis		Li, Y. P., Hou, M. Z., Lu, G. Y., Ciccone, N., Wang, X. D., Dong, L., Cheng, C. and Zhang, H. Z.				world neurosurgery	world neurosurgery	BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the effect of decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) versus conventional treatments (CT) for patients with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (MMI), and to investigate the impact of age and surgical timing on neurological function and mortality. METHODS: We searched English and Chinese databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies (OSs) published before August 2016. The outcomes included good functional outcome (GFO), mortality, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and Barthel Index (BI) score. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included in this meta-analysis (1727 patients). There were statistically significant differences between the DHC and CT groups in terms of GFO (P<0.0001), mortality (P<0.00001), NIHSS and BI score (P<0.0001) at different follow-ups. Between these two groups, significant differences were observed in survival with moderately severe disability (P<0.00001); while no differences were observed in survival with severe disability. In the subgroup analysis, within the DHC group, GFO were less in patients >60 (9.65%) versus ?60 years (38.94%); while more patients >60 had moderately severe or severe disability (55.27%) compared to patients ?60 years (44.21%). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence that DHC could significantly improve the GFO and reduces the mortality of patients of all ages with MMI as compared with CT, without increasing patients surviving with severe disability. However, patients in DHC group suffered more frequently with moderately severe disability. Moreover, patients aged >60 years with MMI had higher risk of surviving with moderately severe or severe disability and less GFO.			2017				4992
Should syndesmotic screws be removed after surgical fixation of unstable ankle fractures? a systematic review		Dingemans, S. A., Rammelt, S., White, T. O., Goslings, J. C. and Schepers, T.				the bone & joint journal	the bone & joint journal	AIMS: In approximately 20% of patients with ankle fractures, there is an concomitant injury to the syndesmosis which requires stabilisation, usually with one or more syndesmotic screws. The aim of this review is to evaluate whether removal of the syndesmotic screw is required in order for the patient to obtain optimal functional recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library for articles in which the syndesmotic screw was retained. Articles describing both removal and retaining of syndesmotic screws were included. Excluded were biomechanical studies, studies not providing patient related outcome measures, case reports, studies on skeletally immature patients and reviews. No restrictions regarding year of publication and language were applied. RESULTS: A total of 329 studies were identified, of which nine were of interest, and another two articles were added after screening the references. In all, two randomised controlled trials (RCT) and nine case-control series were found. The two RCTs found no difference in functional outcome between routine removal and retaining the syndesmotic screw. All but one of the case-control series found equal or better outcomes when the syndesmotic screw was retained. However, all included studies had substantial methodological flaws. CONCLUSIONS: The currently available literature does not support routine elective removal of syndesmotic screws. However, the literature is of insufficient quality to be able to draw definitive conclusions. Secondary procedures incur a provider and institutional cost and expose the patient to the risk of complications. Therefore, in the absence of high quality evidence there appears to be little justification for routine removal of syndesmotic screws.

Social support and protection from depression: systematic review of current findings in Western countries		Gariépy, G., Honkaniemi, H. and Quesnel-Vallée, A.				the british journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science	the british journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science	BACKGROUND: Numerous studies report an association between social support and protection from depression, but no systematic review or meta-analysis exists on this topic. AIMS: To review systematically the characteristics of social support (types and source) associated with protection from depression across life periods (childhood and adolescence; adulthood; older age) and by study design (cross-sectional v. cohort studies). METHOD: A systematic literature search conducted in February 2015 yielded 100 eligible studies. Study quality was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist, followed by meta-analyses. RESULTS: Sources of support varied across life periods, with parental support being most important among children and adolescents, whereas adults and older adults relied more on spouses, followed by family and then friends. Significant heterogeneity in social support measurement was noted. Effects were weaker in both magnitude and significance in cohort studies. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge gaps remain due to social support measurement heterogeneity and to evidence of reverse causality bias.			2016				5697
Interventions to Prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections, Including HIV, Among Young People in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review of the Published and Gray Literature		Kalamar, A. M., Bayer, A. M. and Hindin, M. J.				the journal of adolescent health : official publication of the society for adolescent medicine	the journal of adolescent health : official publication of the society for adolescent medicine	Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, are prevalent among adolescents and can have lasting adverse health consequences. The objective of this review is to identify high-quality interventions and evaluations to decrease STI transmission and related risky behaviors among young people in low- and middle-income countries. PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, Cinahl Plus, Popline, and the Cochrane Databases were searched without language limitations for articles published through November 2015. Gray literature was searched by hand. Reference tracing was utilized, as well as the unpacking of systematic reviews. Retained articles were those that were evaluated as having high-quality interventions and evaluations using standardized scoring. Twenty-one high-quality interventions and evaluations were abstracted. Three reported declines in STI diagnoses, three reported declines in STI symptoms, six showed declines in risky sexual behavior, seven reported increases in abstinence, 11 found increases in condom use, and five reported increases in health care utilization. There is a wide range of rigorously evaluated high-quality interventions included in this review that can inform researchers, donors, and policy makers about where to make strategic investments to decrease the spread of STIs, including HIV. With the recent advent of biomarkers, researchers can use a gold standard measure to assess intervention impact. The diversity of interventions can allow decision makers to tailor interventions to the context, age range, and gender of the target population.			2016				7912
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with previous coronary artery bypass surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Ando, T., Briasoulis, A., Holmes, A. A., Afonso, L., Schreiber, T. and Kondur, A.				international journal of cardiology	international journal of cardiology	BACKGROUND: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery have increased risk for aortic valve replacement. Whether surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers better outcomes in this population is unclear. We aimed to assess outcomes of TAVR and SAVR in patients with previous CABG. METHODS: A systematic literature search of Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane library was conducted. Studies that reported clinical outcomes (perioperative or mid-term all-cause-mortality, cardiovascular mortality, pacemaker implantation, hospital duration and stroke) were included. Random-effect modeling was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Five cohort studies including a total of 872 patients (423 in TAVR, 449 in SAVR) were analyzed. STS scores were comparable between the two groups. No difference in all-cause-mortality, cardiovascular mortality and stroke at 30days, 1year and total follow-up period was seen between the two groups. TAVR patients had higher pacemaker implantation rates (OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.66-6.38, p<0.001, I(2)=21%) and shorter hospital stay (-2.63days, 95% CI -5.20 to -0.04, p=0.05, I(2)=43%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with previous CABG who underwent TAVR had similar perioperative and long-term survival while experiencing more pacemaker implantations and shorter hospital stay compared to those who had SAVR making TAVR a safe and efficacious alternative to SAVR.			2016				9944
Efficacy and safety of repeated oral sucrose for repeated procedural pain in neonates: A systematic review		Gao, H., Gao, H., Xu, G., Li, M., Du, S., Li, F., Zhang, H. and Wang, D.				international journal of nursing studies	international journal of nursing studies	BACKGROUND: Although sucrose is most extensively examined for its analgesia effect on a single procedural pain, neonates in neonatal intensive care units can be exposed to numerous painful procedures every day requiring multiple doses of sucrose. Some experiments have been performed to examine the efficacy and safety of repeated sucrose administration for repeated procedural pain; however, a systematic review of this topic has not yet been carried out. OBJECTIVE: To identify and assess the evidence demonstrating the efficacy and safety of repeated sucrose for repeated procedural pain in neonates. METHOD: A systematic review was conducted using the Cochrane methodology. Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), CBMdisc, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang databases were searched through December 2015. All related abstracts were reviewed and the full texts of relevant articles were studied. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Risk of bias was assessed for RCTs using quality critical appraisal criteria recommended by Cochrane Handbook. A standardised data form was used to extract information. RESULTS: Eight RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Different study designs were used in the included RCTs, which did not allow us to carry out a meta-analysis. The findings from this review indicated that repeated sucrose was effective in reducing both behavioral pain response and composite pain scores during repeated procedural pain. However, as for physiological pain response, one trial found less variability in physiological pain response for term neonates in the sucrose group than the sterile water group, while two trials demonstrated repeated sucrose was inefficacious for preterm neonates. Regarding the clinical outcomes, no study reported adverse effects related to the repeated sucrose administration. Regarding the neurobehavioral development, two trials reported repeated sucrose for repeated procedural pain would not lead to poor neurologic development, while one trial reported that preterm infants <31 weeks' gestational age who received >10 doses of sucrose per 24h in the first week of life had poorer neurologic development compared with infants who received fewer sucrose doses. What's more, no study reported the long-term neurobehavioral development outcome of neonates who repeatedly received sucrose across repeated procedural pain. CONCLUSION: Evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of repeated sucrose across repeated procedural pain for neonates is limited. More prospective, multi-centered, large randomized controlled clinical trials with a standardised study design are required before sucrose can be recommended widely as an analgesia for repeated procedural pain in neonates.			2016				6306
Anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of catheter-related thrombosis in adults and children on parenteral nutrition: a systematic review and critical appraisal		Barco, S., Atema, J. J., Coppens, M., Serlie, M. J. and Middeldorp, S.				blood transfusion = trasfusione del sangue	blood transfusion = trasfusione del sangue	BACKGROUND: Patients on parenteral nutrition require a central venous access and are at risk of catheter-related thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and vena cava syndrome. Parenteral nutrition guidelines suggest anticoagulation for the primary prevention of catheter-related thrombosis during long-term parenteral nutrition. We conducted a systematic review of the efficacy, safety and feasibility of anticoagulant use for preventing and treating catheter-related thrombosis during parenteral nutrition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched for interventional and observational studies on adults and children receiving systemic anticoagulants during either short- or long-term parenteral nutrition delivered via central venous access. Primary outcomes were: objectively-confirmed catheter-related thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and bleeding. Secondary outcomes were: heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, prevalence of anticoagulation, and quality of International Normalised Ratio management in vitamin K antagonist-treated patients. RESULTS: We identified 1,199 studies, of which 23 were included. Seven interventional studies of short-term parenteral nutrition (adult population, n=5) were classified as low-quality: in those, intravenous unfractionated heparin did not prevent catheter-related thrombosis if compared to saline. No interventional studies were conducted in patients on long-term parenteral nutrition. Observational data were sparse, rarely focusing on anticoagulation, and overall of low quality. The reported use of anticoagulants was between 22 and 66% in recent multicentre cohorts. DISCUSSION: The amount and quality of data in this area are very suboptimal: most studies are outdated and involved heterogeneous populations. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to allow conclusions to be reached regarding the efficacy and safety of anticoagulants in this setting.			2017				4712
Effects of flaxseed and Hypericum perforatum on hot flash, vaginal atrophy and estrogen-dependent cancers in menopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Ghazanfarpour, M., Sadeghi, R., Latifnejad Roudsari, R., Khadivzadeh, T., Khorsand, I., Afiat, M. and Esmaeilizadeh, M.				avicenna journal of phytomedicine	avicenna journal of phytomedicine	"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed at evaluation of the efficacy of Hypericum perforatum and flaxseed on hot flash, vaginal atrophy and estrogen-dependent cancers in menopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (RCT) to explore trials that assessed the effectiveness of H. perforatum and flaxseed on hot flash, vaginal atrophy and estrogen-dependent cancers. In this regard, the following terms were used ""menopause AND H. perforatum OR flaxseed OR Linum usitatissimum. Only randomized controlled trials were included in the study. RESULTS: Nine RCTs were included in this systematic review. Based on the literature, flaxseed showed beneficial effect on hot flash frequency and intensity, which was not statistically significant. According to two trials, flaxseed showed estrogenic effects; however, no conclusion regarding cancer promoting or protecting effects can be made. The evidence of the efficacy of the flaxseed on alleviating vaginal atrophy was also limited due to inconsistent findings in this regard. One trial declared that Vitex agnus-castus and H. perforatum showed comparable decrease in the frequency of hot flashes. CONCLUSION: The results of our systematic review suggest beneficial effect on vasomotor symptom with both of flaxseed and H. perforatum. Consistent conclusion regarding estrogen-dependent cancers and maturation value is limited due to small number of trials related to flaxseed. Further trials are still needed to confirm the results of our systematic review."			2016				7297
Topical Treatment of Facial Seborrheic Dermatitis: A Systematic Review		Gupta, A. K. and Versteeg, S. G.				american journal of clinical dermatology	american journal of clinical dermatology	BACKGROUND: Facial seborrheic dermatitis (SD), a chronic inflammatory skin condition, can impact quality of life, and relapses can be frequent. Three broad categories of agents are used to treat SD: antifungal agents, keratolytics, and corticosteroids. Topical therapies are the first line of defense in treating this condition. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to critically review the published literature on topical treatments for facial SD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane library databases for original clinical studies evaluating topical treatments for SD. We then conducted both a critical analysis of the selected studies by grading the evidence and a qualitative comparison of results among and within studies. RESULTS: A total of 32 studies were eligible for inclusion, encompassing 18 topical treatments for facial SD. Pimecrolimus, the focus of seven of the 32 eligible studies, was the most commonly studied topical treatment. CONCLUSION: Promiseb(®), desonide, mometasone furoate, and pimecrolimus were found to be effective topical treatments for facial SD, as they had the lowest recurrence rate, highest clearance rate, and the lowest severity scores (e.g., erythema, scaling, and pruritus), respectively. Ciclopirox olamine, ketoconazole, lithium (gluconate and succinate), and tacrolimus are also strongly recommended (level A recommendations) topical treatments for facial SD, as they are consistently effective across high-quality trials (randomized controlled trials).			2017				4776
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Intravesical Hyaluronic Acid and Hyaluronic Acid/Chondroitin Sulfate Instillation for Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome		Pyo, J. S. and Cho, W. J.				cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology	cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology	BACKGROUND/AIMS: To assess the efficacy of intravesical hyaluronic acid (HA) and HA/chondroitin sulfate (CS) instillation in patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome by systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using the keywords: 'interstitial cystitis' or 'painful bladder syndrome' or 'bladder pain syndrome' and 'hyaluronic acid', up to March 31, 2016. The primary outcome was visual analogue scale related pain symptom (VAS). Secondary outcomes were the O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI) and Problem Index (ICPI), frequency, nocturia, bladder volume, and voided urine volume. RESULTS: Ten articles involving 390 patients were retrieved and assessed in analysis. A significant improvement in mean VAS on fixed-effect and random-effect models (mean difference [MD] -3.654, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.814 to -3.495, and MD -3.206, 95% CI -4.156 to -2.257, respectively) was found. Significant improvements were found in the ICSI (MD -3.223, 95% CI -4.132 to -2.315) and ICPI (MD -2.941, 95% CI -3.767 to -2.116). Similarly, the other outcomes were significantly improved. CONCLUSION: Intravesical HA and HA/CS instillation improved pain symptom, quality of life, and other outcomes and could be included as therapeutic modality of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome.			2016				7239
The Effectiveness of Technology-Supported Exercise Therapy for Low Back Pain: A Systematic Review		Matheve, T., Brumagne, S. and Timmermans, A. A.				american journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation / association of academic physiatrists	american journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation / association of academic physiatrists	Various technological systems have been developed to assist exercise therapy for low back pain. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview and to assess the effectiveness of the available technology-supported exercise therapy (TSET) programs for low back pain. The electronic databases Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PEDro, IEEE, and ACM were searched until January 2016. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using electronic technological systems simultaneously with exercise therapy for patients with low back pain were included. Twenty-five RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen studies involved patients with chronic low back pain, and electromyography biofeedback was the most prevalent type of technological support. This review shows that TSET seems to improve pain, disability, and quality of life for patients with low back pain, and that a standard treatment combined with an additional TSET program might be superior to a standard treatment alone. However, TSET seems not more effective compared to other interventions or a placebo intervention for improving these outcomes, which may partially be explained by the analytical approach of the current TSET-programs. For most technologies, only a limited number of RCTs are available, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of individual technological systems.			2017				4345
Nonnucleoside Reverse-transcriptase Inhibitor- vs Ritonavir-boosted Protease Inhibitor-based Regimens for Initial Treatment of HIV Infection: A Systematic Review and Metaanalysis of Randomized Trials		Borges Á, H., Lundh, A., Tendal, B., Bartlett, J. A., Clumeck, N., Costagliola, D., Daar, E. S., Echeverría, P., Gisslén, M., Huedo-Medina, T. B., Hughes, M. D., Huppler Hullsiek, K., Khabo, P., Komati, S., Kumar, P., Lockman, S., MacArthur, R. D., Maggiolo, F., Matteelli, A., Miro, J. M., Oka, S., Petoumenos, K., Puls, R. L., Riddler, S. A., Sax, P. E., Sierra-Madero, J., Torti, C. and Lundgren, J. D.				clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the infectious diseases society of america	clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the infectious diseases society of america	BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) cause faster virologic suppression, while ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r) recover more CD4 cells. However, individual trials have not been powered to compare clinical outcomes. METHODS: We searched databases to identify randomized trials that compared NNRTI- vs PI/r-based initial therapy. A metaanalysis calculated risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs), as appropriate. Primary outcome was death or progression to AIDS. Secondary outcomes were death, progression to AIDS, and treatment discontinuation. We calculated RR of virologic suppression and MD for an increase in CD4 cells at week 48. RESULTS: We included 29 trials with 9047 participants. Death or progression to AIDS occurred in 226 participants in the NNRTI arm and in 221 in the PI/r arm (RR, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, .87-1.22; 12 trials; n = 3825), death in 205 participants in the NNRTI arm vs 198 in the PI/r arm (1.04; 0.86-1.25; 22 trials; n = 8311), and progression to AIDS in 140 participants in the NNRTI arm vs 144 in the PI/r arm (1.00; 0.80-1.25; 13 trials; n = 4740). Overall treatment discontinuation (1.12; 0.93-1.35; 24 trials; n = 8249) and from toxicity (1.21; 0.87-1.68; 21 trials; n = 6195) were comparable, but discontinuation due to virologic failure was more common with NNRTI (1.58; 0.91-2.74; 17 trials; n = 5371). At week 48, there was no difference between NNRTI and PI/r in virologic suppression (RR, 1.03; 0.98-1.09) or CD4(+) recovery (MD, -4.7 cells; -14.2 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS: We found no difference in clinical and viro-immunologic outcomes between NNRTI- and PI/r-based therapy.			2016				9943
Current methods of sedation in dental patients - a systematic review of the literature		Corcuera-Flores, J. R., Silvestre-Rangil, J., Cutando-Soriano, A. and López-Jiménez, J.				medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal	medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal	"OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this systematic literature review is to identify the safest and most effective sedative drugs so as to ensure successful sedation with as few complications as possible. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic literature review of the PubMed MEDLINE database was carried out using the key words ""conscious sedation,"" ""drugs,"" and ""dentistry."" A total of 1,827 scientific articles were found, and these were narrowed down to 473 articles after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. These 473 studies were then individually assessed for their suitability for inclusion in this literature review. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies were selected due to their rigorous study design and conduciveness to further, more exhaustive analysis. The selected studies included a total of 1,0003 patients classified as ASA I or II. Midazolam was the drug most frequently used for successful sedation in dental surgical procedures. Ketamine also proved very useful when administered intranasally, although some side effects were observed when delivered via other routes of administration. Both propofol and nitrous oxide (N2O) are also effective sedative drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Midazolam is the drug most commonly used to induce moderate sedation in dental surgical procedures, and it is also very safe. Other sedative drugs like ketamine, dexmedetomidine and propofol have also been proven safe and effective; however, further comparative clinical studies are needed to better demonstrate which of these are the safest and most effective."			2016				5761
Effects of group sports on health-related physical fitness of overweight youth: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Oliveira, A., Monteiro, Â, Jácome, C., Afreixo, V. and Marques, A.				scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports	scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports	Group sports interventions have been developed to improve health-related physical fitness of overweight/obese youth. However, its benefits are not systematically documented. This study synthesizes the evidence about the effects of group sports on health-related physical fitness of overweight/obese youth. Pubmed, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, SportDiscus, and Academic Search Complete were searched in February 2016. Studies assessing the effects of group sports on body composition, cardiorespiratory endurance, muscle strength, flexibility, and neuromotor fitness of overweight/obese youth (aged <18 years) were included. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated with Cohen's d and its 95% confidence intervals (CI). Improvements were found in (i) body composition - percentage of fat body mass (pooled ES = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.24-1.10) and waist circumference (ES = 0.69; P = 0.004); (ii) cardiorespiratory endurance - peak oxygen consumption (pooled ES = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.13-0.92) and (iii) muscle strength - hand grip strength (ES = 0.72; P = 0.003). No significant effects were found for body mass index (pooled ES = 0.27; 95% CI = -0.14 to 0.69), percentage of lean body mass (ES = 0.01; P > 0.05), maximal power output (ES from 0 to 0.06; P > 0.05), sit-and-reach test (pooled ES = 0.26; 95% CI = -0.16 to 0.68) and agility test (ES = 0; P = 0.48). Group sports improve body composition, cardiorespiratory endurance, and hand grip strength of overweight/obese youth. Flexibility and neuromotor fitness do not seem to change following group sports.			2017				4881
The effects of honey compared to silver sulfadiazine for the treatment of burns: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials		Aziz, Z. and Abdul Rasool Hassan, B.				burns : journal of the international society for burn injuries	burns : journal of the international society for burn injuries	Evidence from animal studies and trials suggests that honey may accelerate wound healing. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of honey compared with silver dressings on the healing of burn wounds. Relevant databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of honey compared with silver sulfadiazine (SSD) were searched. The quality of the selected trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The primary endpoints considered were wound healing time and the number of infected wounds rendered sterile. Nine RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Based on moderate quality evidence there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups, favoring honey in healing time (MD -5.76days, 95% CI -8.14 to -3.39) and the proportions of infected wounds rendered sterile (RR 2.59; 95% CI 1.58-2.88). The available evidence suggests that honey dressings promote better wound healing than silver sulfadiazine for burns.			2017				5029
The Safety and Efficacy of Diphoterine® for Ocular and Cutaneous Burns in Humans		Lynn, D. D., Zukin, L. M. and Dellavalle, R.				cutaneous and ocular toxicology	cutaneous and ocular toxicology	"CONTEXT: Diphoterine, developed by the French company Prevor, is a polyvalent, chelating, amphoteric and slightly hypertonic solution used in the management of chemical cutaneous and ocular burns. While used extensively in Europe and Canada, it is has not been approved by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as an alternative to the water-rinse method due to a lack of evidence of its safety and efficacy on human subjects. An unbiased and extensive systematic review was undertaken in order to better understand Diphoterine's safety and efficaciousness on humans. OBJECTIVE: Review the safety and efficacy of Diphoterine for treating chemical burns of the skin and eyes in humans. METHODS: Data sources: Information sources included Pubmed, the National Library of Medicine's Medline Database, and the ""Publications"" sections of the Prevor website. Search terms included Diphoterine, chemical burn, ocular burn, and cutaneous burn. STUDY SELECTION: Any study type published through a peer-reviewed journal up to May 2016 were considered eligible. Published data must have included Diphoterine in the treatment of chemical burns on the skin or eyes as well as meet other specified criteria. Acceptable studies had to use either a quantitative (e.g. number of work days lost) or qualitative (e.g. level of erythema) approach when measuring cutaneous or ocular lesion outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent assessment of article inclusion by 2 authors using predefined criteria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Diphoterine is safe and highly effective in improving healing time, healing sequelae, and pain management of chemical burns on the skin and eyes of humans. Outcomes are significantly improved when compared to water or a physiologic solution equivalent. We recommend that this product be readily available to emergency responders and companies that expose their employees to hazardous chemical substances in order to improve healing sequelae, pain management, and lost work days from these type of burns."			2017				5193
A Systematic Review of Add-on Pharmacologic Therapy in the Treatment of Resistant Hypertension		Tataru, A. P. and Barry, A. R.				american journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions	american journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions	INTRODUCTION: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of add-on pharmacologic therapies in the treatment of resistant hypertension (RH), defined as blood pressure (BP) above target despite three antihypertensive agents. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar (inception to June 2016) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any antihypertensive agent with control in patients with RH. Outcomes of interest included differences in BP, cardiovascular events, and serious adverse events. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in RCTs was used to evaluate the quality of the included trials. RESULTS: Six RCTs were identified, including 749 participants. Four RCTs compared spironolactone with placebo and two used an active comparator. Four of the six studies did not report sufficient information regarding methods. A quantitative meta-analysis was not performed because of clinical heterogeneity among the RCTs. Compared with placebo, spironolactone reduced mean office BP by ~10 to 20 mmHg/~3 to 9 mmHg and home BP by ~10/4 mmHg. Compared with doxazosin or bisoprolol, spironolactone reduced clinic and home systolic BP, but not diastolic BP. Hyperkalemia occurred in ~3% of patients receiving spironolactone. Cardiovascular events were not consistently reported. All trials were limited by low enrollment, short follow-up, and inconsistent reporting of clinically meaningful outcomes and/or serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone has the best evidence as add-on pharmacologic therapy in patients with RH, but data are limited.			2017				4323
First-line non-cytotoxic therapy in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review of ten randomised clinical trials		Poorthuis, M. H., Vernooij, R. W., van Moorselaar, R. J. and de Reijke, T. M.				bju international	bju international	OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate all available treatment options in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane libraries up to March 1, 2016 for peer-reviewed publications on randomised clinical trials (RCTs). RCTs were included if progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life (QoL), or adverse events (AEs) were quantitatively evaluated. We assessed the risk of bias (RoB) with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and graded the evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group's approach. RESULTS: We included 25 articles, reporting on ten unique RCTs describing seven different comparisons. In one RCT, a prolonged OS and PFS (high quality) were found with abiraterone and prednisone compared to placebo plus prednisone. In one RCT, a prolonged OS and PFS (high quality) were found with enzalutamide compared to placebo. In two RCTs, a prolonged OS (high and moderate quality) was found with (223) radium compared to placebo, but its effect on PFS is unknown. In three RCTs, a prolonged OS (moderate quality) was found with sipuleucel-T compared to placebo, but no prolonged PFS (low quality). In one RCT a prolonged PFS (high quality) was found with orteronel compared to placebo, but no prolonged OS (moderate quality). In one RCT, a prolonged OS (moderate quality) was found with bicalutamide compared to placebo, but its effect on PFS is unknown. In one study, a prolonged PFS (high quality) was found with enzalutamide compared to bicalutamide, but its effect on OS is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: The best evidence was found for abiraterone and enzalutamide for effective prolongation of PFS and OS to treat chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients. However, taking both QoL and AEs into consideration, other treatment modalities could be considered for individual patients. This article is protected by copyright.

Defining the role of perioperative statin treatment in patients after cardiac surgery: A meta-analysis and systematic review of 20 randomized controlled trials		Yuan, X., Du, J., Liu, Q. and Zhang, L.				international journal of cardiology	international journal of cardiology	BACKGROUND: Although statin use has been indicated to prevent atrial fibrillation in previous observational and experimental trials, the issue remains inadequately and insufficiently explored. We therefore performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of perioperative statin therapy on complications and short-term prognosis following cardiac surgery. METHODS: A search of the PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane database of controlled trials was performed from inception to June 2016 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary endpoints included postoperative atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Twenty studies involving 4338 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Among the patients who underwent cardiac surgery, perioperative statin therapy was significantly associated with a decreased risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation (OR: 0.50; P=0.0004), particularly in the subgroup of patients who used atorvastatin and those who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Moreover, perioperative statin use significantly decreased the length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.43; P=0.002). However, no reductions were observed in acute kidney injury, myocardial infarction, postoperative serum creatinine concentration or the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative statin therapy might be promising for the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery, especially for patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery or atorvastatin administration. Additionally, statin use can decrease the length of the hospital stay.			2017				5080
Treatments for gestational diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Farrar, D., Simmonds, M., Bryant, M., Sheldon, T. A., Tuffnell, D., Golder, S. and Lawlor, D. A.				bmj open	bmj open	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of different treatments for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). DESIGN: Systematic review, meta-analysis and network meta-analysis. METHODS: Data sources were searched up to July 2016 and included MEDLINE and Embase. Randomised trials comparing treatments for GDM (packages of care (dietary and lifestyle interventions with pharmacological treatments as required), insulin, metformin, glibenclamide (glyburide)) were selected by two authors and double checked for accuracy. Outcomes included large for gestational age, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycaemia, caesarean section and pre-eclampsia. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses and used Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare pharmacological treatments (ie, including treatments not directly compared within a trial). RESULTS: Forty-two trials were included, the reporting of which was generally poor with unclear or high risk of bias. Packages of care varied in their composition and reduced the risk of most adverse perinatal outcomes compared with routine care (eg, large for gestational age: relative risk0.58 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.68; I(2)=0%; trials 8; participants 3462). Network meta-analyses suggest that metformin had the highest probability of being the most effective treatment in reducing the risk of most outcomes compared with insulin or glibenclamide. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence shows that packages of care are effective in reducing the risk of most adverse perinatal outcomes. However, trials often include few women, are poorly reported with unclear or high risk of bias and report few outcomes. The contribution of each treatment within the packages of care remains unclear. Large well-designed and well-conducted trials are urgently needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42013004608.			2017				4223
Systematic Review of Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in Urological Cancers		Rijnders, M., de Wit, R., Boormans, J. L., Lolkema, M. P. J. and van der Veldt, A. A. M.				european urology	european urology	CONTEXT: In patients with advanced and metastatic urological cancers, clinical outcome may be improved by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). OBJECTIVE: To systematically review relevant literature on efficacy and safety of ICIs in patients with advanced and metastatic urothelial cell cancer (UCC), renal cell cancer (RCC), and prostate cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Relevant databases, including Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, were searched up to March 16, 2017. A narrative review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Six RCTs were included for the systematic review. In platinum-pretreated UCC, efficacy of pembrolizumab was superior to chemotherapy, with longer median overall survival (OS; 10.3 vs 7.4 mo), a higher objective response rate (ORR; 21.1% vs 11.4%, p=0.001), and a lower adverse event rate (60.9% vs 90.2%). Three RCTs assessed the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in advanced RCC. The median OS (25.0 vs 19.6 mo) and the ORR (25% vs 5%) were higher in patients treated with nivolumab compared with second-line everolimus. In all three studies, the safety profile of nivolumab was favorable. In patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, two RCTs were identified, which did not show significant benefits for ipilimumab over placebo. In UCC and RCC, there was no conclusive association between programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor tissue and clinical outcome during pembrolizumab and nivolumab treatment, respectively. CONCLUSION: In metastatic UCC and RCC, pembrolizumab and nivolumab have superior efficacy and safety to second-line chemotherapy and everolimus, respectively. No beneficial effect of ipilimumab was observed in prostate cancer patients. PD-L1 expression status is currently not suitable as a predictive marker for treatment outcome. PATIENT SUMMARY: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are able to reactivate the immune system against tumor cells. In second-line setting, pembrolizumab and nivolumab are safe and confer survival benefit in advanced urothelial cell and renal cell cancer, respectively.			2017				4213
Specialized palliative care in advanced cancer: What is the efficacy? A systematic review		Holmenlund, K., Sjøgren, P. and Nordly, M.				palliative & supportive care	palliative & supportive care	OBJECTIVE: Due to the multiple physical, psychological, existential, and social symptoms involved, patients with advanced cancer often have a reduced quality of life (QoL), which requires specialized palliative care (SPC) interventions. The primary objective of the present systematic review was to review the existing literature about SPC and its effect on QoL, on physical and psychological symptoms, and on survival in adult patients with advanced cancer. METHOD: We utilized a search strategy based on the PICO (problem/population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) framework and employed terminology related to cancer, QoL, symptoms, mood, and palliative care. The search was performed in Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Selected studies were analyzed and categorized according to methods, results, quality of evidence, and strength of recommendation. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected for analysis (out of a total of 1,115 studies). Two other studies were found by hand search, one of which was only published in conference abstract form. The RCTs differed in terms of aims, interventions, control groups, and outcomes; however, the primary aim of all of them was to investigate the effect of SPC on patient QoL. Five studies found improved QoL in the intervention group. Physical symptom intensity decreased in two studies, and three studies found improved mood in the intervention group. However, physical and psychological symptoms were secondary outcomes in these studies. Survival was improved in two studies. All the studies offered generalizability, but the level of evidence validity varied among them. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Due to several methodological limitations, the evidence offered in these studies ranged from low to high. The evidence in this field of study in general is still nascent, but there is growing support for the utilization of SPC to improve the quality of life of adult patients with advanced cancer. The evidence that SPC reduces physical and psychological symptoms is moderate, while the evidence that it prolongs survival is low.			2017				4410
Efficacy and Tolerability of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Based Regimen as Compared to Zidovudine Based Regimens: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Dadi, T. L., Kefale, A. T., Mega, T. A., Kedir, M. S., Addo, H. A. and Biru, T. T.				aids research and treatment	aids research and treatment	BACKGROUND: Although tenofovir (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC)/efavirenz (EFV) and zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC)/efavirenz (EFV) are used as preferred first line regimen, their head-to-head comparison in terms of their efficacy and tolerability was limited. This review aimed to synthesize the best available evidence on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of the two regimens. METHODS: Seven sites and databases in addition to Google search until August 20, 2016, were searched. Only randomized clinical trials conducted on adult population were included in this study. Our primary outcome was viral load suppression while secondary outcomes were death and tolerability. Undetectable viral load is defined as <50 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies/ml. Joanna Briggs institute meta-analysis of statistics assessment and review instrument (JBI-MAStARI) and critical appraisal and data extraction tool were applied for critical assessment and data extraction, respectively. We performed a random effect meta-analysis to pool the relative risk (RR) for viral load suppression (<50 HIV RNA copies/ml and <400 HIV RNA copies/ml), tolerability, and death. RESULT: Data was extracted from four articles, which included a total of 2381 participants. We found superior viral load suppression among tenofovir (TDF) arm compared to zidovudine (ZDV) arm. Tenofovir arm achieves viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/ml (RR = 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.04, 1.21], I(2) = 0%) higher than zidovudine arm. Similarly TDF arm is superior in viral load suppression to <400 HIV RNA copies/ml (RR = 1.19, 95% CI [1.11, 1.27], I(2) = 0%). Moreover, TDF based regimens were more likely to be tolerated than ZDV based regimens (4 trials, 2381 participants (RR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.02, 1.10], I(2) = 51%)). However, forest plot of death shows that it was not significant (RR = 0.91, 95% CI [0.51, 1.62]). CONCLUSION: The use of TDF/FTC/EFV as first line regimen for naïve HIV-1 infected adult patient showed superior viral load suppression and tolerability as compared to ZDV/3TC/EFV. In order to compare the death outcome of both ZDV/3TC/EFV and TDF/FTC/EFV further research is needed.			2017				4970
Systematic review: interventions for abdominal pain management in inflammatory bowel disease		Norton, C., Czuber-Dochan, W., Artom, M., Sweeney, L. and Hart, A.				alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	BACKGROUND: Abdominal pain is frequently reported by people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including in remission. Pain is an under-treated symptom. AIM: To systematically review evidence on interventions (excluding disease-modifying interventions) for abdominal pain management in IBD. METHODS: Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Library) were searched (February 2016). Two researchers independently screened references and extracted data. RESULTS: Fifteen papers were included: 13 intervention studies and two cross-sectional surveys. A variety of psychological, dietary and pharmacological interventions were reported. Four of six studies reported pain reduction with psychological intervention including individualised and group-based relaxation, disease anxiety-related Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and stress management. Both psychologist-led and self-directed stress management in inactive Crohn's disease reduced pain compared with controls (symptom frequency reduction index=-26.7, -11.3 and 17.2 at 6-month follow-up, respectively). Two dietary interventions (alcoholic drinks with high sugar content and fermentable carbohydrate with prebiotic properties) had an effect on abdominal pain. Antibiotics (for patients with bacterial overgrowth) and transdermal nicotine patches reduced abdominal pain. Current and past cannabis users report it relieves pain. One controlled trial of cannabis reduced SF-36 and EQ-5D pain scores (1.84 and 0.7, respectively). These results must be treated with caution: data were derived from predominantly small uncontrolled studies of moderate to low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Few interventions have been tested for IBD abdominal pain. The limited evidence suggests that relaxation and changing cognitions are promising, possibly with individualised dietary changes. There is a need to develop interventions for abdominal pain management in IBD.			2017				4823
Efficacy of glucocorticoids, conventional and targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: a systematic literature review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis		Chatzidionysiou, K., Emamikia, S., Nam, J., Ramiro, S., Smolen, J., van der Heijde, D., Dougados, M., Bijlsma, J., Burmester, G., Scholte, M., van Vollenhoven, R. and Landewé, R.				annals of the rheumatic diseases	annals of the rheumatic diseases	OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic literature review (SLR) informing the 2016 update of the recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: An SLR for the period between 2013 and 2016 was undertaken to assess the efficacy of glucocorticoids (GCs), conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) (tofacitinib and baricitinib) in randomised clinical trials. RESULTS: For GCs, four studies were included in the SLR. Patients without poor prognostic factors experienced benefit when GCs were added to methotrexate (MTX). Lower doses of GCs were similar to higher doses. For csDMARDs, two new studies comparing MTX monotherapy with combination csDMARD were included in the SLR. In the tREACH trial at the end of 12?months no difference between the groups in disease activity, functional ability and radiographic progression was seen, using principles of tight control (treat-to-target). In the CareRA trial, combination therapy with csDMARDs was not superior to MTX monotherapy and monotherapy was better tolerated.For tsDMARDs, tofacitinib and baricitinib were shown to be more effective than placebo (MTX) in different patient populations. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of GCs to csDMARD therapy may be beneficial but the benefits should be balanced against the risk of toxicity. Under tight control conditions MTX monotherapy is not less effective than combination csDMARDs, but better tolerated. Tofacitinib and baricitinib are efficacious in patients with RA, including those with refractory disease.			2017				4723
Thirty Years of Evidence on the Efficacy of Drug Treatments for Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction: A Network Meta-Analysis		Burnett, H., Earley, A., Voors, A. A., Senni, M., McMurray, J. J., Deschaseaux, C. and Cope, S.				circulation. heart failure	circulation. heart failure	BACKGROUND: Treatments that reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), ?-blockers (BB), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), have not been studied in a head-to-head fashion. This network meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of these drugs and their combinations regarding all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic literature review identified 57 randomized controlled trials published between 1987 and 2015, which were compared in terms of study and patient characteristics, baseline risk, outcome definitions, and the observed treatment effects. Despite differences identified in terms of study duration, New York Heart Association class, ejection fraction, and use of background digoxin, a network meta-analysis was considered feasible and all trials were analyzed simultaneously. The random-effects network meta-analysis suggested that the combination of ACEI+BB+MRA was associated with a 56% reduction in mortality versus placebo (hazard ratio 0.44, 95% credible interval 0.26-0.66); ARNI+BB+MRA was associated with the greatest reduction in all-cause mortality versus placebo (hazard ratio 0.37, 95% credible interval 0.19-0.65). A sensitivity analysis that did not account for background therapy suggested that ARNI monotherapy is more efficacious than ACEI or ARB monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The network meta-analysis showed that treatment with ACEI, ARB, BB, MRA, and ARNI and their combinations were better than the treatment with placebo in reducing all-cause mortality, with the exception of ARB monotherapy and ARB plus ACEI. The combination of ARNI+BB+MRA resulted in the greatest mortality reduction.			2017				5258
Double bronchodilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a crude analysis from a systematic review		Lopez-Campos, J. L., Calero-Acuña, C., Márquez-Martín, E., Quintana Gallego, E., Carrasco-Hernández, L., Abad Arranz, M. and Ortega Ruiz, F.				international journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	international journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	OBJECTIVE: The combination of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and a long-acting ?2-agonist (LABA) in a single inhaler is a viable treatment option for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Here, we systematically review the current knowledge on double bronchodilation for the treatment of COPD, with a specific focus on its efficacy versus placebo and/or monotherapy bronchodilation. METHODS: A systematic review of clinical trials investigating LABA/LAMA combination therapies was conducted. Articles were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus on June 26, 2016. We specifically selected clinical trials with a randomized controlled or crossover design published in any scientific journal showing the following characteristics: 1) comparison of different LABA/LAMA combinations in a single inhaler for patients with COPD, 2) dose approved in Europe, and 3) focus on efficacy (versus placebo and/or bronchodilator monotherapy) in terms of lung function, respiratory symptoms, or exacerbations. RESULTS: We analyzed 26 clinical trials conducted on 24,338 patients. All LABA/LAMA combinations were consistently able to improve lung function compared with both placebo and bronchodilator monotherapy. Improvements in symptoms were also consistent versus placebo, showing some lack of correlation for some clinical end points and combinations versus monotherapy bronchodilation. Albeit being an exploratory end point, exacerbations showed an improvement with LABA/LAMA combinations over placebo in some trials; however, scarce information was available in comparison with bronchodilator monotherapy in most studies. CONCLUSION: Our data show consistent improvements for LABA/LAMA combinations, albeit with some variability (depending on the clinical end point, the specific combination, and the comparison group). Clinicians should be aware that these are average differences. All treatments should be tailored at the individual level to optimize clinical outcomes.			2017				4422
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor combination therapy in first-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer: systematic review and network meta-analysis		Batson, S., Mitchell, S. A., Windisch, R., Damonte, E., Munk, V. C. and Reguart, N.				oncotargets and therapy	oncotargets and therapy	INTRODUCTION: The introduction of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) has improved the outlook for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR+ mutations. However, most patients develop resistance, with the result that median progression-free survival (PFS) i?12 months. Combining EGFR-TKIs with other agents, such as bevacizumab, is a promising approach to prolonging remission. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) were undertaken to assess available evidence regarding the benefits of first-line combination therapy involving EGFR-TKIs in patients with advanced NSCLC. METHODS: Literature searches were performed using relevant search terms. Study-level pseudo-individual patient-level data (IPD) were recreated from digitized Kaplan-Meier curve data, using a published algorithm. Study IPD were analyzed using both the proportional hazards and the acceleration failure time (AFT) survival models, and it was concluded that the AFT model was most appropriate. An NMA was performed based on acceleration factors (AFs) using a Bayesian framework to compare EGFR-TKIs and chemotherapy. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials were identified that provided data for EGFR-TKI therapy in patients with EGFR+ tumors. These included studies of afatinib (n=3), erlotinib (n=3), erlotinib plus bevacizumab (n=1) and gefitinib (n=2). Erlotinib plus bevacizumab produced the greatest increase in PFS compared with chemotherapy, with 1/AF being 0.24 (95% credible interval [CrI] 0.17, 0.34). This combination also produced greater increases in PFS compared with EGFR-TKI monotherapy: 1/AF versus afatinib, 0.51 (95% CrI 0.35, 0.73); versus erlotinib, 0.53 (95% CrI 0.39, 0.72) and versus gefitinib, 0.46 (95% CrI 0.32, 0.66). All three EGFR-TKI monotherapies prolonged PFS compared with chemotherapy; estimates of treatment effect ranged from 1/AF 0.53 (95% CrI 0.48, 0.60) for gefitinib to 1/AF 0.46 (95% CrI 0.40, 0.53) for erlotinib. There was no evidence for differences between EGFR-TKI monotherapies, as all 95% CrIs included the null value. CONCLUSION: Although data for erlotinib plus bevacizumab came from a single Phase 2 study, the results of the NMA suggest that adding bevacizumab to erlotinib may be a promising approach to improving the outcomes achieved with EGFR-TKI monotherapy in patients with advanced EGFR+ NSCLC.			2017				4679
Interventions for Alcohol-Related Risky Sexual Behaviors Among College Students: A Systematic Review		Kilwein, T. M., Kern, S. M. and Looby, A.				psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the society of psychologists in addictive behaviors	psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the society of psychologists in addictive behaviors	Alcohol-related risky sexual behaviors are common among college students. Though various interventions targeting these behaviors have been examined, the literature does not currently include a review of these strategies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, yielding 7 randomized controlled trials. Relevant outcome variables included unprotected sex, alcohol in conjunction with sex, and number of sexual partners. Findings suggested that interventions utilizing reminder cues or motivational interviewing-based techniques were largely found to be effective in increasing condom use behaviors among intoxicated individuals, while support for personalized normative feedback (PNF) for the same outcome was mixed. However, PNF interventions were generally effective in reducing alcohol use in conjunction with sex. Finally, though few studies examined number of sexual partners, there are mixed findings for interventions (i.e., motivational interviewing, PNF) targeting this outcome. Overall, there is promising, albeit mixed, evidence of the effectiveness of interventions targeting various alcohol-related risky sexual behaviors among college students. Strengths, limitations, and implications of the findings of this systematic review for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record			2017				4371
Efficacy of Psychotherapies for Borderline Personality Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Cristea, I. A., Gentili, C., Cotet, C. D., Palomba, D., Barbui, C. and Cuijpers, P.				jama psychiatry	jama psychiatry	IMPORTANCE: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a debilitating condition, but several psychotherapies are considered effective. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to assess the efficacy of psychotherapies for BPD populations. DATA SOURCES: Search terms were combined for borderline personality and randomized trials in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from database inception to November 2015), as well as the reference lists of earlier meta-analyses. STUDY SELECTION: Included were randomized clinical trials of adults with diagnosed BPD randomized to psychotherapy exclusively or to a control intervention. Study selection differentiated stand-alone designs (in which an independent psychotherapy was compared with control interventions) from add-on designs (in which an experimental intervention added to usual treatment was compared with usual treatment alone). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction coded characteristics of trials, participants, and interventions and assessed risk of bias using 4 domains of the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool (independent extraction by 2 assessors). Outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Standardized mean differences (Hedges g) were calculated using all outcomes reported in the trials for borderline symptoms, self-harm, suicide, health service use, and general psychopathology at posttest and follow-up. Differential treatment retention at posttest was analyzed, reporting odds ratios. RESULTS: Thirty-three trials (2256 participants) were included. For borderline-relevant outcomes combined (symptoms, self-harm, and suicide) at posttest, the investigated psychotherapies were moderately more effective than control interventions in stand-alone designs (g?=?0.32; 95% CI, 0.14-0.51) and add-on designs (g?=?0.40; 95% CI, 0.15-0.65). Results were similar for other outcomes, including stand-alone designs: self-harm (g?=?0.32; 95% CI, 0.09-0.54), suicide (g?=?0.44; 95% CI, 0.15-0.74), health service use (g?=?0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.58), and general psychopathology (g?=?0.32; 95% CI, 0.09-0.55), with no differences between design types. There were no significant differences in the odds ratios for treatment retention (1.32; 95% CI, 0.87-2.00 for stand-alone designs and 1.01; 95% CI, 0.55-1.87 for add-on designs). Thirteen trials reported borderline-relevant outcomes at follow-up (g?=?0.45; 95% CI, 0.15-0.75). Dialectical behavior therapy (g?=?0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.53) and psychodynamic approaches (g?=?0.41; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69) were the only types of psychotherapies more effective than control interventions. Risk of bias was a significant moderator in subgroup and meta-regression analyses (slope ??=?-0.16; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.03; P?=?.02). Publication bias was persistent, particularly for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Psychotherapies, most notably dialectical behavior therapy and psychodynamic approaches, are effective for borderline symptoms and related problems. Nonetheless, effects are small, inflated by risk of bias and publication bias, and particularly unstable at follow-up.			2017				4589
Cholesterol-reducing agents for treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials		Akhigbe, T., Zolnourian, A. and Bulters, D.				world neurosurgery	world neurosurgery	BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal haemorrhage induced cerebral vasospasm; DIND, poor neurological outcome and mortality are major causes of mortality and morbidity. The effects of cholesterol lowering agents in these patients remain controversial. This up to date systematic review and meta-analyses aimed to evaluate the efficacy of statin use in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage METHODS: Systematic review of literature conducted using electronic database searched up to September 2016 included Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials in the Cochrane library, Medline, Embase and Science Citation Index Expanded database to identify relevant studies. Data extracted and critically appraised by two independent authors. In addition, fixed or random effects model were applied to calculated pooled results based on degree of heterogeneity RESULTS: Ten RCTs with 1214 patients with 587 patients received statins and 627 patients in the placebo group. Statins were found to significantly reduced cerebral vasospasm (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.28-0.78, P= 0.002) and DIND (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97, P= 0.03). However, there was no significant decrease in mortality (OR: 0.77, 955 CI: 054-1.11, P= 0.16) and poor neurological outcome (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.75-1.23, P= 0.74). CONCLUSION: The outcome of this meta-analysis showed that use of statins in aSAH might have the potential effect to decrease occurrence of vasospasm and DIND. However, there was no benefit in the reduction of mortality and poor neurological outcome. This is a call for further research.			2017				4269
Systematic Literature Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Treatment Outcomes in Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma		van Beurden-Tan, C. H., Franken, M. G., Blommestein, H. M., Uyl-de Groot, C. A. and Sonneveld, P.				journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the american society of clinical oncology	journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the american society of clinical oncology	Purpose Since 2000, many new treatment options have become available for relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM) after a long period in which dexamethasone and melphalan had been the standard treatment. Direct comparisons of these novel treatments, however, are lacking. This makes it extremely difficult to evaluate the relative added value of each new treatment. Our aim was to synthesize all efficacy evidence, enabling a comparison of all current treatments for R/R MM. Methods We performed a systematic literature review to identify all publicly available phase III randomized controlled trial evidence. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and the Web site www.ClinicalTrials.gov . In addition, two trials presented at two international hematology congresses (ie, ASCO 2016 and European Hematology Association 2016) were added to include the most recent evidence. In total, 17 randomized controlled trials were identified, including 18 treatment options. The evidence was synthesized using a conventional network meta-analysis. To include all treatments within one network, two treatment options were combined: (1) bortezomib monotherapy and bortezomib plus dexamethasone, and (2) thalidomide monotherapy and thalidomide plus dexamethasone. Results The combination of daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone was identified as the best treatment. It was most favorable in terms of (1) hazard ratio for progression-free survival (0.13; 95% credible interval, 0.09 to 0.19), and (2) probability of being best (99% of the simulations). This treatment combination reduced the risk of progression or death by 87% versus dexamethasone, 81% versus bortezomib plus dexamethasone, and 63% versus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone. Conclusion Our network meta-analysis provides a complete overview of the relative efficacy of all available treatments for R/R MM. Until additional data from randomized studies are available, on the basis of this analysis, the combination of daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone seems to be the best treatment option.			2017				4531
Inadvertent P-hacking among trials and systematic reviews of the effect of progestogens in pregnancy? A systematic review and meta-analysis		Prior, M., Hibberd, R., Asemota, N. and Thornton, J. G.				bjog : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology	bjog : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology	"BACKGROUND: Progestogens have been evaluated in numerous trials and meta-analyses, many of which concluded they were effective. However, two large trials PROMISE and OPPTIMUM have recently concluded that progesterone was ineffective. This raises the possibility that earlier studies and reviews had been biased by either selective publication or selective choice of outcomes, so called ""P-hacking"". OBJECTIVES: To compare the findings all progestogen trials and systematic reviews with those of trials with pre-registered primary outcomes which avoided selective outcome reporting. SEARCH STRATEGY: Search of PubMed, the Cochrane Library and trial registries. Registration PROSPERO CRD42016035303. SELECTION CRITERIA: Systematic reviews of randomised trials comparing progestogen with placebo in pregnancy and the individual trials included in those reviews. The subset of trials reporting a pre-registered primary outcome were compared with the totality of trials and reviews. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For reviews all outcomes were included. For individual trials all outcomes reported in the systematic reviews were included. For the comparison group we recorded the registered primary outcome from trials that were either registered before they started, or registered during the recruitment phase and also double blind. MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen of twenty-nine meta-analyses concluded that progestogens were effective. Twenty-two trials reported their pre-registered primary outcomes. There was no effect of progesterone on primary registered dichotomous outcome RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.94-1.07). Only one of the 22 showed a nominally statistically significant benefit. AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: When evaluated in registered double-blind trials with analysis restricted to predefined primary outcomes, progestational agents in pregnancy are ineffective. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Progestogens to prevent pregnancy loss, an example of P-hacking."			2017				4790
Preferred Management of Primary Deep Arm Vein Thrombosis		Vazquez, F. J., Paulin, P., Poodts, D. and Gándara, E.				european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	european journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the european society for vascular surgery	"OBJECTIVE: Given its rarity, the management of primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis is controversial. Although anticoagulation alone is commonly advocated for its treatment, it is unclear if this will reduce the risk of developing post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). The aim of this ""Evidence Driven"" Clinical Scenario is to evaluate whether more aggressive treatments (including catheter directed thrombolysis or surgery) might help reduce the risk of PTS or recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). METHODS: An electronic systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE and Embase was conducted. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies were eligible. The primary outcome was PTS. RESULTS: The initial search identified 146 articles, and 36 more were identified during a secondary search. In total, 25 studies, reporting the outcome of 1271 patients, were included. None of the studies included was a randomised controlled trial and the large majority of studies were retrospective cohorts. The use of anticoagulation alone was associated with a significant risk of PTS. In patients treated with surgery with or without thrombolysis the incidence of PTS was significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Current evidence, albeit with some methodological limitations, suggests that anticoagulation may not be sufficient to prevent PTS in patients with primary upper extremity DVT and that surgery with or without thrombolysis to repair the anatomical defects is needed."			2017				5205
Laparoscopic cryoablation vs. percutaneous cryoablation for treatment of small renal masses: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Jiang, K., Tang, K., Guo, X., Liu, H., Chen, H., Chen, Z., Xu, H. and Ye, Z.				oncotarget	oncotarget	CONTEXT: Laparoscopic cryoablation (LCA) and percutaneous cryoablation(PCA) have been used on patients with small renal masses(SRMs) for many years. However, clinical studies assessing their feasibility and safety have reported contradictory outcomes. This systematic evaluation was performed to obtain comprehensive evidence with regard to the feasibility and safety of PCA compared with LCA. METHODS: A systematic search of Embase, Pubmed, Medline, the Cochrane Library were performed to identify studies that compared LCA with PCA were published up to Mar 2016. Outcomes of interest included perioperative, pathologic variables, and complications. RESULTS: Thirteen studies estimating LCA versus PCA were included for meta-analysis. Patients undergoing PCA were significantly older(WMD = -0.16 years; P = 0.01) and patients with posterior tumors were significantly prefer undergoing PCA than LCA(OR = 0.23; P = 0.0007), whereas patients with anterior tumors were significantly prefer undergoing LCA(OR = 3.82; P = 0.02). although PCA was associated with shorter hospital stay(WMD = 1.17 days; P < 0.0001) and higher incidence rate of perirenal hematoma(OR = 0.18; P < 0.0001). All the other analyzed parameters were similar, regardless of the surgical approach. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing PCA have shorter hospital stay and PCA was more frequently used in older patients and posterior tumors. Whereas LCA was associated with lower incidence rate of perirenal hematoma. Further multicenter, prospective and long-term follow-up RCTs are required to verify these findings.			2017				4826
Effects of short-wave therapy in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Wang, H., Zhang, C., Gao, C., Zhu, S., Yang, L., Wei, Q. and He, C.				clinical rehabilitation	clinical rehabilitation	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of short-wave therapy with sham or no intervention for the management of patients with knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: We searched the following databases from their inception up to 26 October 2016: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, CINAHL and OpenGrey. Studies included randomized controlled trials compared with a sham or no intervention in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The results were calculated via standardized mean difference (SMD) and risk ratio for continuous variables outcomes as well as dichotomous variables, respectively. Heterogeneity was explored by the I(2) test and inverse-variance random effects analysis was applied to all studies. RESULTS: Eight trials (542 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The effect of short-wave therapy on pain was found positive (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -0.84 to -0.21). The pain subgroup showed that patients received pulse modality achieved clinical improvement (SMD, -0.83; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.52) and the pain scale in female patients decreased (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -0.98 to -0.08). In terms of extensor strength, short-wave therapy was superior to the control group ( p?<?0.05, I(2)?=?0%). There was no significant difference in the physical function (SMD, -0.16; 95% CI, -0.36 to 0.05). For adverse effects, there was no significant difference between the treatment and control group. CONCLUSION: Short-wave therapy is beneficial for relieving pain caused by knee osteoarthritis (the pulse modality seems superior to the continuous modality), and knee extensor muscle combining with isokinetic strength. Function is not improved.			2017				4936
A comparison of discontinuation rates of tofacitinib and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis		Park, S. K., Lee, M. Y., Jang, E. J., Kim, H. L., Ha, D. M. and Lee, E. K.				clinical and experimental rheumatology	clinical and experimental rheumatology	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the discontinuation rates of tofacitinib and biologics (tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), abatacept, rituximab, and tocilizumab) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients considering inadequate responses (IRs) to previous treatment(s). METHODS: Randomised controlled trials of tofacitinib and biologics - reporting at least one total discontinuation, discontinuation due to lack of efficacy (LOE), and discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) - were identified through systematic review. The analyses were conducted for patients with IRs to conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) and for patients with biologics-IR, separately. Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to estimate rate ratio (RR) of a biologic relative to tofacitinib with 95% credible interval (CrI), and probability of RR being <1 (P[RR<1]). RESULTS: The analyses of 34 studies showed no significant differences in discontinuation rates between tofacitinib and biologics in the cDMARDs-IR group. In the biologics-IR group, however, TNFi (RR 0.17, 95% CrI 0.01-3.61, P[RR<1] 92.0%) and rituximab (RR 0.20, 95% CrI 0.01-2.91, P[RR<1] 92.3%) showed significantly lower total discontinuation rates than tofacitinib did. Despite the difference, discontinuation cases owing to LOE and AEs revealed that tofacitinib was comparable to the biologics. CONCLUSIONS: The comparability of discontinuation rate between tofacitinib and biologics was different based on previous treatments and discontinuation reasons: LOE, AEs, and total (due to other reasons). Therefore, those factors need to be considered to decide the optimal treatment strategy.			2017				4713
Electronic nicotine delivery systems and/or electronic non-nicotine delivery systems for tobacco smoking cessation or reduction: a systematic review and meta-analysis		El Dib, R., Suzumura, E. A., Akl, E. A., Gomaa, H., Agarwal, A., Chang, Y., Prasad, M., Ashoorion, V., Heels-Ansdell, D., Maziak, W. and Guyatt, G.				bmj open	bmj open	OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and/or electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS) versus no smoking cessation aid, or alternative smoking cessation aids, in cigarette smokers on long-term tobacco use. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Web of Science up to December 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Three pairs of reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles, extracted data from included studies on populations, interventions and outcomes and assessed their risk of bias. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to rate overall certainty of the evidence by outcome. DATA SYNTHESIS: Three randomised trials including 1007 participants and nine cohorts including 13?115 participants proved eligible. Results provided by only two RCTs suggest a possible increase in tobacco smoking cessation with ENDS in comparison with ENNDS (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.38; p=0.07; I(2)=0%, risk difference (RD) 64/1000 over 6 to 12?months, low-certainty evidence). Results from cohort studies suggested a possible reduction in quit rates with use of ENDS compared with no use of ENDS (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.00; p=0.051; I(2)=56%, very low certainty). CONCLUSIONS: There is very limited evidence regarding the impact of ENDS or ENNDS on tobacco smoking cessation, reduction or adverse effects: data from RCTs are of low certainty and observational studies of very low certainty. The limitations of the cohort studies led us to a rating of very low-certainty evidence from which no credible inferences can be drawn. Lack of usefulness with regard to address the question of e-cigarettes' efficacy on smoking reduction and cessation was largely due to poor reporting. This review underlines the need to conduct well-designed trials measuring biochemically validated outcomes and adverse effects.			2017				4707
Triple Oral Therapy Versus Antitumor Necrosis Factor Plus Methotrexate (MTX) in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Inadequate Response to MTX: A Systematic Literature Review		Mary, J., De Bandt, M., Lukas, C., Morel, J. and Combe, B.				the journal of rheumatology	the journal of rheumatology	OBJECTIVE: For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX), the relative effectiveness of the combination of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) compared with the combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and MTX, as second-line therapy, is uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerance of triple oral DMARD therapy versus anti-TNF agents associated with MTX in patients with RA after MTX failure. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the literature up to November 2015 in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane library, and abstracts from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) meetings from 2006 to 2015. Articles were included if they were of randomized controlled trials of patients receiving triple oral combination therapy (TT; MTX + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine) compared with anti-TNF agents plus MTX. Treatment effects were examined by disease activity [Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28)], ACR and EULAR response criteria, structural damage by the modified total Sharp score, and functional disability by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). RESULTS: Our search identified 263 articles; only 5 fulfilled the selection criteria. Analysis of ACR and EULAR response criteria, DAS28, and modified Sharp scores favored anti-TNF agents combined with MTX. Functional disability (HAQ) and rates of adverse events did not differ between treatments. CONCLUSION: In patients with RA in whom MTX has failed, the addition of a TNF antagonist to MTX may be a valid option, with better clinical outcomes and better radiographic results in the presence of poor prognostic factors. In the absence of poor prognostic factors and/or with contraindications to biologic agents, TT retains its place in the therapeutic strategy for RA in a currently restricted economic context.			2017				5127
Effect of Immediate Administration of Antibiotics in Patients With Sepsis in Tertiary Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Johnston, A. N., Park, J., Doi, S. A., Sharman, V., Clark, J., Robinson, J. and Crilly, J.				clinical therapeutics	clinical therapeutics	"PURPOSE: The goal of this review was to synthesize existing evidence regarding outcomes (mortality) for patients who present to the emergency department, are administered antibiotics immediately (within 1 hour) or later (>1 hour), and are diagnosed with sepsis. METHODS: A search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL, using the MeSH descriptors ""sepsis,"" ""systemic inflammatory response syndrome,"" ""mortality,"" ""emergency,"" and ""antibiotics,"" was performed to identify studies reporting time to antibiotic administration and mortality outcome in patients with sepsis. The included studies (published in English between 1990 and 2016) listed patient mortality based on time to antibiotic administration. Studies were evaluated for methodologic quality, and data were extracted by using a data extraction form tailored to this study. From an initial pool of 582 potentially relevant studies, 11 studies met our inclusion criteria, 10 of which had quantitative data for meta-analysis. Three different models (a random effects model, a bias-adjusted quality-effects [synthetic bias] model, and an inverse variance heterogeneity model) were used to perform the meta-analysis. FINDINGS: The pooled results suggest a significant 33% reduction in mortality odds for immediate (within 1 hour) compared with later (>1 hour) antibiotic administration (OR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.59-0.75]) in patients with sepsis. IMPLICATIONS: Immediate antibiotic administration (<1 hour) seemed to reduce patient mortality. There was some minor negative asymmetry suggesting that the evidence may be biased toward the direction of effect. Nevertheless, this study provides strong evidence for early, comprehensive, sepsis management in the emergency department."			2017				5019
Systolic Blood Pressure Reduction and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis		Bundy, J. D., Li, C., Stuchlik, P., Bu, X., Kelly, T. N., Mills, K. T., He, H., Chen, J., Whelton, P. K. and He, J.				jama cardiology	jama cardiology	IMPORTANCE: Clinical trials have documented that lowering blood pressure reduces cardiovascular disease and premature deaths. However, the optimal target for reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP) is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of mean achieved SBP levels with the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in adults with hypertension treated with antihypertensive therapy. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from inception to December 15, 2015, supplemented by manual searches of the bibliographies of retrieved articles. STUDY SELECTION: Studies included were clinical trials with random allocation to an antihypertensive medication, control, or treatment target. Studies had to have reported a difference in mean achieved SBP of 5 mm Hg or more between comparison groups. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted from each study independently and in duplicate by at least 2 investigators according to a standardized protocol. Network meta-analysis was used to obtain pooled randomized results comparing the association of each 5-mm Hg SBP category with clinical outcomes after adjusting for baseline risk. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Forty-two trials, including 144?220 patients, met the eligibility criteria. In general, there were linear associations between mean achieved SBP and risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, with the lowest risk at 120 to 124 mm Hg. Randomized groups with a mean achieved SBP of 120 to 124 mm Hg had a hazard ratio (HR) for major cardiovascular disease of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.60-0.83) compared with randomized groups with a mean achieved SBP of 130 to 134 mm Hg, an HR of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.48-0.72) compared with those with a mean achieved SBP of 140 to 144 mm Hg, an HR of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.34-0.63) compared with those with a mean achieved SBP of 150 to 154 mm Hg, and an HR of 0.36 (95% CI, 0.26-0.51) compared with those with a mean achieved SBP of 160 mm Hg or more. Likewise, randomized groups with a mean achieved SBP of 120 to 124 mm Hg had an HR for all-cause mortality of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58-0.93) compared with randomized groups with a mean achieved SBP of 130 to 134 mm Hg, an HR of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.45-0.77) compared with those with a mean achieved SBP of 140 to 144 mm Hg, an HR of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.36-0.71) compared with those with a mean achieved SBP of 150 to 154 mm Hg, and an HR of 0.47 (95% CI, 0.32-0.67) compared with those with a mean achieved SBP of 160 mm Hg or more. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that reducing SBP to levels below currently recommended targets significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. These findings support more intensive control of SBP among adults with hypertension.			2017				5064
Urinary Leukotriene E4 to Determine Aspirin Intolerance in Asthma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Hagan, J. B., Laidlaw, T. M., Divekar, R., O'Brien, E. K., Kita, H., Volcheck, G. W., Hagan, C. R., Lal, D., Teaford, H. G., Erwin, P. J., Zhang, N. and Rank, M. A.				the journal of allergy and clinical immunology. in practice	the journal of allergy and clinical immunology. in practice	BACKGROUND: Urinary leukotriene E4 (ULTE4) may be a biomarker that distinguishes aspirin-intolerant asthma from other asthma subtypes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the diagnostic testing accuracy of ULTE4 as a marker of aspirin intolerance in patients with asthma using previously published studies. METHODS: We identified relevant clinical studies from a systematic review of English and non-English articles using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (inception to February 10, 2015). Articles were screened at the abstract and full-text level by 2 independent reviewers. We included previously published studies that analyzed ULTE4 in human subjects with asthma characterized as having or not having aspirin intolerance on the basis of a specified definition: convincing history of aspirin intolerance, positive aspirin challenge, or both as the criterion standard. Individual-level data points from all included studies were obtained and analyzed. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 867 potential articles, of which 86 were reviewed at the full-text level and 10 met criteria for inclusion. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values of ULTE4 to determine aspirin intolerance in subjects with asthma were 0.55, 0.82, 0.75, and 0.66 (Amersham-enzyme immunoassay); 0.76, 0.77, 0.70, and 0.78 (Cayman-enzyme immunoassay); 0.70, 0.81, 0.86, and 0.79 (mass spectrometry); and 0.81,0.79, 0.65, and 0.88 (radioimmunoassay) at optimal thresholds of 192, 510, 167 to 173, and 66 to 69 pg/mg Cr, respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio for each methodology was 6.0, 11.9, 10.5, and 19.1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ULTE4 is a marker for aspirin-intolerant asthma and could potentially be used as a clinical test to identify the risk of aspirin intolerance in subjects with asthma.			2017				4500
Risks and benefits of pre-operative dexmedetomidine in oral and maxillofacial surgeries: A systematic review		Davoudi, A., Movahedian Attar, B. and Shadmehr, E.				expert opinion on drug safety	expert opinion on drug safety	INTRODUCTION: Oral and maxillofacial surgeries might induce anxiety and pain to the patients. Sedative agents are one of the best ways for eliminating such consequences. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a recent sedative agent which presents higher sedative quality with greater specificity than other drugs. The aim of present paper is to evaluate the risks and benefits of administrating DEX during oral and maxillofacial surgeries by reviewing high quality released articles. Areas covered: Searches on PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were completed with focus on randomized controlled trials (RCT). Related articles, from 2000 to 2015, were selected based on inclusion criteria and quality assessments factors. Full texts of the selected articles were screened and their significant information were gathered for judgments. Expert opinion: 17 RCTs on a total of 765 patients were screened. Some of the difficulties during reviewing the articles were: different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of drugs when combined with DEX, different time spots and method of monitoring, including studies on both minor and major surgeries for better data collection. Recent researches are going to focus on application of DEX for in-office procedures because of its desirable properties. Nevertheless, the analgesic and amnesic features of DEX are still questionable.			2017				4832
Antibiotics-first strategy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults is associated with increased rates of peritonitis at surgery. A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing appendectomy and non-operative management with antibiotics		Podda, M., Cillara, N., Di Saverio, S., Lai, A., Feroci, F., Luridiana, G., Agresta, F., Vettoretto, N. and Appendicitis, Acoi Study Group on Acute				the surgeon : journal of the royal colleges of surgeons of edinburgh and ireland	the surgeon : journal of the royal colleges of surgeons of edinburgh and ireland	BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical diagnosis in young patients, with lifetime prevalence of about 7%. Debate remains on whether uncomplicated AA should be operated or not. Aim of this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was to assess current evidence on antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated AA compared to standard surgical treatment. METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Google Scholar and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for randomized controlled trials comparing antibiotic therapy (AT) and surgical therapy-appendectomy (ST) for uncomplicated AA. Trials were reviewed for primary outcome measures: treatment efficacy based on 1 year follow-up, recurrence at 1 year follow-up, complicated appendicitis with peritonitis identified at the time of surgical operation and post-intervention complications. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and period of sick leave. RESULTS: Five RCTs comparing AT and ST qualified for inclusion in meta-analysis, with 1.351 patients included: 632 in AT group and 719 in ST group. Higher rate of treatment efficacy based on 1 year follow-up was found in ST group (98.3% vs 75.9%, P < 0.0001), recurrence at 1 year was reported in 22.5% of patients treated with antibiotics. Rate of complicated appendicitis with peritonitis identified at time of surgical operation was higher in AT group (19.9% vs 8.5%, P = 0.02). No statistically significant differences were found when comparing AT and ST groups for the outcomes of overall post-intervention complications (4.3% vs 10.9%, P = 0.32), post-intervention complications based on the number of patients who underwent appendectomy (15.8% vs 10.9%, P = 0.35), length of hospital stay (3.24 ± 0.40 vs 2.88 ± 0.39, P = 0.13) and period of sick leave (8.91 ± 1.28 vs 10.27 ± 0.24, P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: With significantly higher efficacy and low complication rates, appendectomy remains the most effective treatment for patients with uncomplicated AA. The subgroups of patients with uncomplicated AA where antibiotics can be more effective, should be accurately identified.			2017				5130
Corticosteroid Use and Growth After Pediatric Solid Organ Transplantation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Tsampalieros, A., Knoll, G. A., Molnar, A. O., Fergusson, N. and Fergusson, D. A.				transplantation	transplantation	BACKGROUND: A number of corticosteroid minimization and avoidance protocols for post-solid organ transplant have been developed. The study objective was to examine the effect of corticosteroid withdrawal/avoidance on growth and safety parameters in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients. METHODS: A systematic review using Medline and Embase was performed. All randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies comparing corticosteroid withdrawal/avoidance to controls receiving corticosteroids in pediatric transplant recipients which reported growth as change in height or final height were included. Two reviewers independently abstracted study data and assessed quality. RESULTS: The search yielded 930 records, 14 separate studies involving 1146 patients. Renal RCTs (n = 5) showed that corticosteroid withdrawal/avoidance was associated with a significant increase in growth (mean difference in height standard deviation score [SDS], 0.18; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.07-0.29; P = 0.001) compared with those remaining on steroids. In liver RCTs (n = 2), mean difference in height SDS was -0.20 (95% CI, -1.08 to 0.68; P = 0.66). Results for renal observational studies (n = 5) was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.03-0.65; P = 0.03). The most pronounced effect was seen in prepubertal children with SDS of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.14-0.41; P < 0.0001). In pubertal participants this was not observed (SDS, 0.06; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.15; P = 0.24). Corticosteroid withdrawal/avoidance was not associated with acute rejection (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; P = 0.63), graft failure (OR, 0.45; P = 0.08), or death (OR, 0.34; P = 0.16) in renal trials. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid withdrawal/avoidance in pediatric renal transplantation is associated with a significant improvement in height. Prepubertal patients appeared to have the greatest benefit. Importantly, the improvement in growth was not accompanied by increased rejection or worsening patient/allograft survival in the short term.			2017				4504
Renal Functional Outcomes after Surgery, Ablation, and Active Surveillance of Localized Renal Tumors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Patel, H. D., Pierorazio, P. M., Johnson, M. H., Sharma, R., Iyoha, E., Allaf, M. E., Bass, E. B. and Sozio, S. M.				clinical journal of the american society of nephrology : cjasn	clinical journal of the american society of nephrology : cjasn	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Management strategies for localized renal masses suspicious for renal cell carcinoma include radical nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy, thermal ablation, and active surveillance. Given favorable survival outcomes across strategies, renal preservation is often of paramount concern. To inform clinical decision making, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing renal functional outcomes for radical nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy, thermal ablation, and active surveillance. DESIGN, SETTINGS, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1, 1997 to May 1, 2015 to identify comparative studies reporting renal functional outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed for change in eGFR, incidence of CKD, and AKI. RESULTS: We found 58 articles reporting on relevant renal functional outcomes. Meta-analyses showed that final eGFR fell 10.5 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) lower for radical nephrectomy compared with partial nephrectomy and indicated higher risk of CKD stage 3 or worse (relative risk, 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.97 to 3.32) and ESRD for radical nephrectomy compared with partial nephrectomy. Overall risk of AKI was similar for radical nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy, but studies suggested higher risk for radical nephrectomy among T1a tumors (relative risk, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.66). In general, similar findings of worse renal function for radical nephrectomy compared with thermal ablation and active surveillance were observed. No differences in renal functional outcomes were observed for partial nephrectomy versus thermal ablation. The overall rate of ESRD was low among all management strategies (0.4%-2.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Renal functional implications varied across management strategies for localized renal masses, with worse postoperative renal function for patients undergoing radical nephrectomy compared with other strategies and similar outcomes for partial nephrectomy and thermal ablation. Further attention is needed to quantify the changes in renal function associated with active surveillance and nephron-sparing approaches for patients with preexisting CKD.			2017				4655
CYD-TDV dengue vaccine: systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy, immunogenicity and safety		Godói, I. P., Pires Lemos, L. L., de Araújo, V. E., Bonoto, B. C., Godman, B. and Guerra Júnior, A. A.				journal of comparative effectiveness research	journal of comparative effectiveness research	INTRODUCTION: Dengue virus (DENV) is a serious global health problem. CYD-TDC (Dengvaxia(®)) was the first vaccine to gain regulatory approval to try and address this problem. AIM: Summarize all available evidence on the immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of the CYD-TDV dengue vaccine. METHOD: Meta-analysis and systematic review. RESULTS: The best and worst immunogenicity results were for DENV4 and DENV1, respectively. Vaccine efficacy of 60% was derived from studies with participants aged 2-16 years old, with DENV4 and DENV2 presenting the best and worst results, respectively. Erythema and swelling were more frequent with CYD-TDV. No differences were detected for systemic adverse events. CONCLUSION: CYD-TDV showed moderate efficacy in children and adolescents. From the immunogenicity results in adults, we can expect satisfactory efficacy from vaccination in this population.			2017				4300
Systematic review of the safety and efficacy of palivizumab among infants and young children with cystic fibrosis		Kua, K. P. and Lee, S. W. H.				pharmacotherapy	pharmacotherapy	BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common pathogen in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF). The use of palivizumab prophylaxis for RSV infection as the standard of care for infants with CF remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of palivizumab in reducing the incidence of RSV hospitalization in children with CF who are younger than 2 years of age. METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL) were searched from inception until January 31, 2017 for clinical studies investigating the use of palivizumab in infants with CF aged less than 2 years. The primary outcome was hospitalization rate due to RSV infection. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for respiratory illness, length of hospital stay, safety (adverse effects), and cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis. RESULTS: The review included a total of ten studies (six cohort studies, two before-and-after studies, one cross-sectional study, and one randomized controlled trial) involving 3,891 patients with CF. Seven studies reported that palivizumab prophylaxis had a positive impact on the rate of RSV hospitalization. Five studies (n=3,404) reported that palivizumab prophylaxis significantly reduced the rate of hospitalization due to RSV infection compared to no prophylaxis. One study (n=5) demonstrated patients with CF who received palivizumab had no RSV hospitalization. Another study showed infants with CF receiving palivizumab (n=117) had a lower risk of hospitalization for RSV infection compared with premature infants (gestational age <35 completed weeks) who received palivizumab (n=4,880). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from the literature suggests that palivizumab may have a potential role in reducing RSV hospitalization in children aged less than 2 years with CF. Given the lack of overall data, additional research is warranted to better understand the efficacy and safety of prophylactic palivizumab in infants with CF. This article is protected by copyright.

Apneic oxygenation during intubation in the emergency department and during retrieval: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Binks, M. J., Holyoak, R. S., Melhuish, T. M., Vlok, R., Bond, E. and White, L. D.				the american journal of emergency medicine	the american journal of emergency medicine	BACKGROUND: Hypoxemia increases the risk of intubation markedly. Such concerns are multiplied in the emergency department (ED) and during retrieval where patients may be unstable, preparation or preoxygenation time limited and the environment uncontrolled. Apneic oxygenation is a promising means of preventing hypoxemia in this setting. AIM: To test the hypothesis that apnoeic oxygenation reduces the incidence of hypoxemia during endotracheal intubation in the ED and during retrieval. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of six databases for all relevant studies published up to November 2016. Included studies evaluated apneic oxygenation during intubation in the ED and during retrieval. There were no exemptions based on study design. All studies were assessed for level of evidence and risk of bias. The Review Manager 5.3 software was used to perform meta-analysis of the pooled data. RESULTS: Six trials and a total 1822 cases were included for analysis. The study found a significant reduction in the incidence of desaturation (RR=0.76, p=0.002) and critical desaturation (RR=0.51, p=0.01) when apneic oxygenation was implemented. There was also a significant improvement in first pass intubation success rate (RR=1.09, p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Apneic oxygenation may reduce patient hypoxemia during intubation performed in the ED and during retrieval. It also improves intubation first-pass success rate in this setting.			2017				4355
Selective Cannabinoids for Chronic Neuropathic Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis		Meng, H., Johnston, B., Englesakis, M., Moulin, D. E. and Bhatia, A.				anesthesia and analgesia	anesthesia and analgesia	BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus on the role of selective cannabinoids for the treatment of neuropathic pain (NP). Guidelines from national and international pain societies have provided contradictory recommendations. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis (SR-MA) was to determine the analgesic efficacy and safety of selective cannabinoids compared to conventional management or placebo for chronic NP. METHODS: We reviewed randomized controlled trials that compared selective cannabinoids (dronabinol, nabilone, nabiximols) with conventional treatments (eg, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, or a combination of these) or placebo in patients with chronic NP because patients with NP may be on any of these therapies or none if all standard treatments have failed to provide analgesia and or if these treatments have been associated with adverse effects. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other major databases up to March 11, 2016, were searched. Data on scores of numerical rating scale for NP and its subtypes, central and peripheral, were meta-analyzed. The certainty of evidence was classified using the Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials including 1219 patients (614 in selective cannabinoid and 605 in comparator groups) were included in this SR-MA. There was variability in the studies in quality of reporting, etiology of NP, type and dose of selective cannabinoids. Patients who received selective cannabinoids reported a significant, but clinically small, reduction in mean numerical rating scale pain scores (0-10 scale) compared with comparator groups (-0.65 points; 95% confidence interval, -1.06 to -0.23 points; P = .002, I = 60%; Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation: weak recommendation and moderate-quality evidence). Use of selective cannabinoids was also associated with improvements in quality of life and sleep with no major adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Selective cannabinoids provide a small analgesic benefit in patients with chronic NP. There was a high degree of heterogeneity among publications included in this SR-MA. Well-designed, large, randomized studies are required to better evaluate specific dosage, duration of intervention, and the effect of this intervention on physical and psychologic function.			2017				4548
Is Laparoscopic appendectomy feasible for complicated appendicitis ?A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Yu, M. C., Feng, Y. J., Wang, W., Fan, W., Cheng, H. T. and Xu, J.				international journal of surgery (london, england)	international journal of surgery (london, england)	BACKGROUND: laparoscopic appendectomy(LA) has proved to be a safe alternative to open appendectomy(OA) in uncomplicated appendicitis; however, the feasibility of LA for complicated appendicitis(CA) has not been conclusively determined. OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and safety of LA for CA through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and web of Science was performed for eligible studies published from the inception of the databases to January 2016. All studies comparing LA and OA for CA were reviewed. After literature selection, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two reviewers independently, and meta-analysis was conducted using Revman software, vision 5.2. RESULTS: Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 retrospective cohort studies(RCSs) were finally identified. Our meta-analysis showed that LA for CA could reduce the rate of surgical site infections (SSIs) (OR=0.28; 95% CI: 0.25 to0.31, P<0.00001), but LA did not increase the rate of postoperative intra-abdominal abscess(IAA) (OR=0.79; 95% CI: 0.45 to 1.34, P=0.40). The results showed that the operating time in the LA groups was much longer than that in the OA groups (WMD=13.78, 95% CI: 8.99 to 18.57, P<0.00001). However, the length of hospital stays in the LA groups were significantly shorter than those in the OA groups (WMD=-2.47, 95%CI: -3.75 to -1.19, P<0.0002), and the time until oral intake(TTOI) was much earlier in the LA groups than in the OA groups (WMD=-0.88, 95% CI: -1.20 to -0.55, P<0.00001). No significant difference was observed in the times of postoperative analgesia between the two groups(P>0.05). CONCLUSION: LA was feasible and safe for complicated appendicitis, and it not only could shorten the hospital stays and the time until oral intake, but it could also reduce the risk of surgical site infection.			2017				4529
Efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of biosimilars of anti-tumor necrosis factor-? agents in rheumatic diseases; A systematic review and meta-analysis		Komaki, Y., Yamada, A., Komaki, F., Kudaravalli, P., Micic, D., Ido, A. and Sakuraba, A.				journal of autoimmunity	journal of autoimmunity	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of biosimilars of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-? agents compared to their reference agents in immune mediated diseases. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biosimilars of anti-TNF-? agents compared to their reference agents in patients with various immune mediated diseases. The outcomes were the rates of clinical response and adverse events among patients treated with biosimilars compared to their reference agents. Additionally, occurrence of anti-drug antibodies with the use of biosimilars was compared to the reference agents. RESULTS: Nine studies reporting outcomes in 3291 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were identified (5 infliximab, 2 adalimumab, and 2 etanercept). No RCTs in other diseases were found. Biosimilars of infliximab showed similar rates of clinical response compared to the reference agent in RA and AS. Frequency of anti-drug antibody and adverse events were similar except for a slightly, but significantly, higher risk of upper respiratory tract infections with biosimilar (RR 1.54, P = 0.047, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-2.37). Biosimilar of adalimumab showed no differences among any outcomes compared to the reference agent. Biosimilars of etanercept showed no differences for clinical response and frequency of adverse events, but showed a significantly lower rate of anti-drug antibodies at 24-30 weeks (RR 0.05, P <0.0001%, 95% CI = 0.01-0.21). CONCLUSION: In the present study, biosimilars of anti-TNF-? agents had an overall comparable efficacy and safety profile compared to their reference agents in RA and AS supporting their use for these conditions.			2017				4966
Apneic oxygenation reduces the incidence of hypoxemia during emergency intubation: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Pavlov, I., Medrano, S. and Weingart, S.				the american journal of emergency medicine	the american journal of emergency medicine	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Apneic oxygenation has been advocated for the prevention of hypoxemia during emergency endotracheal intubation. Because of conflicting results from recent trials, the efficacy of apneic oxygenation remains unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of apneic oxygenation on the incidence of clinically significant hypoxemia during emergency endotracheal intubation. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched without language and time restrictions for studies of apneic oxygenation performed in a critical care setting. Meta-analysis was conducted with a random-effect model, and according to intention-to-treat allocation wherever applicable. Subgroup analyses were performed to ensure the robustness of findings across various clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eight studies (n=1953) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled absolute risk of clinically significant hypoxemia was 27.6% in the usual care group and 19.1% in the apneic oxygenation group, without any heterogeneity across studies (I(2)=0%; p=0.42). Apneic oxygenation reduced the relative risk of hypoxemia by 30% (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.82). There was a trend toward lower mortality in the apneic oxygenation group (relative risk of death 0.77; 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.02). CONCLUSION: Apneic oxygenation significantly reduces the incidence of hypoxemia during emergency endotracheal intubation. These findings support the inclusion of apneic oxygenation in everyday clinical practice.			2017				4452
Investigating the Efficacy of Dexmedetomidine as an Adjuvant to Local Anesthesia in Brachial Plexus Block: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 18 Randomized Controlled Trials		Hussain, N., Grzywacz, V. P., Ferreri, C. A., Atrey, A., Banfield, L., Shaparin, N. and Vydyanathan, A.				regional anesthesia and pain medicine	regional anesthesia and pain medicine	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dexmedetomidine has been thought to be an effective adjuvant to local anesthetics in brachial plexus blockade. We sought to clarify the uncertainty that still exists as to its true efficacy. METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to assess the ability of dexmedetomidine to prolong the duration and hasten the onset of motor and sensory blockade when used as an adjuvant to local anesthesia for brachial plexus blockade versus using local anesthesia alone (control). A search strategy was created to identify eligible articles in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library. The methodological quality for each included study was evaluated using the Cochrane Tool for Risk of Bias. RESULTS: Eighteen randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis (n = 1092 patients). The addition of dexmedetomidine significantly reduced sensory block time onset time by 3.19 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.60 to -1.78 minutes; I = 95%; P < 0.00001), prolonged sensory block duration by 261.41 minutes (95% CI, 145.20-377.61 minutes; I = 100%; P < 0.0001), reduced the onset of motor blockade by 2.92 minutes (95% CI, -4.37 to -1.46 minutes; I = 96%, P < 0.0001), and prolonged motor block duration by 200.90 minutes (CI, 99.24-302.56 minutes; I = 99%; P = 0.0001) as compared with control. Dexmedetomidine also significantly prolonged the duration of analgesia by 289.31 minutes (95% CI, 185.97-392.64 minutes; I = 99%; P < 0.00001). Significantly more patients experienced intraoperative bradycardia with dexmedetomidine (risk difference [RD], 0.06; 95% CI, 0.00-0.11; I = 72%; P = 0.03); however, there was no difference in the incidence of intraoperative hypotension (RD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.04; I = 3%; P = 0.45). It is important to note that all studies reported that intraoperative bradycardia was either transient in nature or reversible, when needed, with the administration of intravenous atropine. CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine has the ability to hasten the onset and prolong the duration of blockade when used as an adjuvant to local anesthesia for brachial plexus blockade. Considering an analgesic effect to be either decreased pain, a longer duration of analgesic block, or decreased opioid consumption, the addition of dexmedetomidine to local anesthetics for brachial plexus blockade was found to significantly improve analgesia in all 18 included studies. However, patients receiving dexmedetomidine should be continuously monitored for the potentially harmful but reversible adverse effect of intraoperative bradycardia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, level I.			2017				5090
Efficacy of salpingectomy at hysterectomy to reduce the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer: a systematic review		Darelius, A., Lycke, M., Kindblom, J. M., Kristjansdottir, B., Sundfeldt, K. and Strandell, A.				bjog : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology	bjog : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology	BACKGROUND: It has been argued that salpingectomy would reduce the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), based on the theory of the tube being the site of origin. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of 'salpingectomy' associated with ovarian cancer risk and 'salpingectomy with concomitant hysterectomy' on outcomes of complications including endocrine function. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library. SELECTION CRITERIA: Original studies and systematic reviews were eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each article was quality assessed. Data was extracted and when possible, pooled in meta-analyses. The certainty of evidence across studies was evaluated using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Of 844 articles found, eleven were included. No study evaluated risk reduction for EOC after salpingectomy in conjunction with hysterectomy. Two retrospective studies reported a reduced ovarian cancer risk after indicated salpingectomy compared with no surgery; adjusted hazard ratio 0.65 (95% CI 0.52-0.81) and adjusted odds ratio 0.58 (95% CI 0.36-0.95). Complications did not differ between groups with or without salpingectomy, but were non-systematically reported. Ovarian endocrine function, measured with surrogate outcomes, did not differ at short term follow-up in randomised or observational studies. The certainty of evidence was very low or low for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to state that opportunistic salpingectomy reduces the risk of EOC. The impact on long term endocrine function is unknown. The heterogeneity in results and identified knowledge gaps stress the need for a prospective trial. This article is protected by copyright.

Systematic review with meta-analysis: the efficacy and safety of CT-P13, a biosimilar of anti-tumour necrosis factor-? agent (infliximab), in inflammatory bowel diseases		Komaki, Y., Yamada, A., Komaki, F., Micic, D., Ido, A. and Sakuraba, A.				alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	BACKGROUND: Biosimilars of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-? agents have now become clinically available for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). AIM: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of biosimilars of anti-TNF-? agents in patients with IBD. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched. The outcomes were the pooled rates of clinical response or remission, sustained clinical response or remission, and adverse events in patients with IBD induced with or switched to biosimilars of anti-TNF-? agents. RESULTS: Eleven observational studies reporting outcomes in 829 patients treated with biosimilar of infliximab (CT-P13) were identified. The pooled rates of clinical response among Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) at 8-14 weeks were 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.65-0.88) and 0.74 (95% CI = 0.65-0.82), respectively, and at 24-30 weeks were 0.77 (95% CI = 0.63-0.86) and 0.77 (95% CI = 0.67-0.85) respectively. Adverse events were rare (CD, 0.08 (95% CI = 0.02-0.26); UC, 0.08 (95% CI = 0.03-0.17)). The pooled rates of sustained clinical response among CD and UC after switching from infliximab to CT-P13 at 30-32 weeks were 0.85 (95% CI = 0.71-0.93) and 0.96 (95% CI = 0.58-1.00), respectively, and at 48-63 weeks were 0.75 (95% CI = 0.44-0.92) and 0.83 (95% CI = 0.19-0.99) respectively. Adverse events were rare (CD, 0.10, 95% CI = 0.02-0.31; UC, 0.22, 95% CI = 0.04-0.63). CONCLUSIONS: CT-P13 was associated with excellent clinical efficacy and safety profile, supporting its use in the treatment of IBD.			2017				4733
Comparison of palbociclib in combination with letrozole or fulvestrant with endocrine therapies for advanced/metastatic breast cancer: network meta-analysis		Chirila, C., Mitra, D., Colosia, A., Ling, C., Odom, D., Iyer, S. and Kaye, J. A.				current medical research and opinion	current medical research and opinion	BACKGROUND: Palbociclib is the first cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor approved in the United States for HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer, in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women or with fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy. We compared progression-free survival (PFS) and discontinuations due to adverse events for palbociclib combinations against other endocrine therapies using a mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature review identified relevant trials. Separate analyses were conducted for each palbociclib combination using a Bayesian approach. Treatment rankings were established using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). RESULTS: Sixty-five unique studies met inclusion criteria. Palbociclib plus letrozole had the highest SUCRA value (99.9%) and was associated with significantly longer PFS than all comparators in treatment-naïve patients (hazard ratios [HRs] ranged from 0.41 to 0.58). Palbociclib plus fulvestrant had the second highest SUCRA value (93.9%) and, in previously treated patients, yielded significantly longer PFS than most comparators (HRs ranged from 0.26 to 0.46); the exception was everolimus plus exemestane, with similar PFS (HR, 1.04; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.58-1.76). Palbociclib plus fulvestrant was associated with significantly lower odds of discontinuation due to adverse events than everolimus plus exemestane (odds ratio, 0.14; 95% CrI, 0.05-0.39). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the two palbociclib combinations yielded significantly greater PFS than endocrine therapy in treatment-naïve and previously treated patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Palbociclib plus fulvestrant was associated with significantly less toxicity than everolimus plus exemestane.			2017				5277
The Effectiveness of Manual Therapy for Relieving Pain, Stiffness, and Dysfunction in Knee Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Xu, Q., Chen, B., Wang, Y., Wang, X., Han, D., Ding, D., Zheng, Y., Cao, Y., Zhan, H. and Zhou, Y.				pain physician	pain physician	BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is the most common form of arthritis, leading to pain disability in seniors and increased health care utilization. Manual therapy is one widely used physical treatment for KOA. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events (AEs) of manual therapy compared to other treatments for relieving pain, stiffness, and physical dysfunction in patients with KOA. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of manual therapy for KOA. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of manual therapy for patients with KOA from the inception to October 2015 without language restrictions. RCTs compared manual therapy to the placebo or other interventional control with an appropriate description of randomization. Two reviewers independently conducted the search results identification, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment. The methodological quality was assessed by PEDro scale. Pooled data was expressed as standard mean difference (SMD), with 95% confident intervals (CIs) in a random effects model. The meta-analysis of manual therapy for KOA on pain, stiffness, and physical function were conducted. RESULTS: Fourteen studies involving 841 KOA participants compared to other treatments were included. The methodological quality of most included RCTs was poor. The mean PEDro scale score was 6.6. The meta-analyses results showed that manual therapy had statistically significant effects on relieving pain (standardized mean difference, SMD = -0.61, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.28, P = 76%), stiffness (SMD = -0.58, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.21, P = 81%), improving physical function (SMD = -0.49, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.22, P = 65%), and total score (SMD = -0.56, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.35, P = 50%). But in the subgroups, manual therapy did not show significant improvements on stiffness and physical function when treatment duration was less than 4 weeks. And the long-term information for manual therapy was insufficient. LIMITATIONS: The limitations of this systematic review include the paucity of literature and inevitable heterogeneity between included studies. CONCLUSION: The preliminary evidence from our study suggests that manual therapy might be effective and safe for improving pain, stiffness, and physical function in KOA patients and could be treated as complementary and alternative options. However, the evidence may be limited by potential bias and poor methodological quality of included studies. High-quality RCTs with long-term follow-up are warranted to confirm our findings.Key words: Knee osteoarthritis, manual therapy, systematic review.			2017				4544
Efficacy and safety of high-dose influenza vaccine in elderly adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Wilkinson, K., Wei, Y., Szwajcer, A., Rabbani, R., Zarychanski, R., Abou-Setta, A. M. and Mahmud, S. M.				vaccine	vaccine	INTRODUCTION: Older adults are prioritized for influenza vaccination but also have lowered antibody responses to the vaccine. Higher-doses of influenza antigen may increase immune response and thus be more effective. Our objectives were to compare the efficacy and safety of the high-dose influenza vaccine to the standard-dose influenza vaccine in the elderly (age>65). METHODS: Data sources: Randomized trials (RCTs) from Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Cochrane Library (Wiley), ClinicalTrials.gov, reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently identified RCTs comparing high-dose influenza vaccine (60?g of hemagglutinin per strain) to standard-dose influenza vaccine (15?g of hemagglutinin per strain) in adults over the age of 65years. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and funding sources. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: We included seven eligible trials; all were categorized as having a low (n=3) or unclear (n=4) risk of bias. Patients receiving the high-dose vaccine had significantly less risk of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza infections (Relative Risk 0.76, 95%CI 0.65 to 0.90; I(2) 0%, 2 trials, 41,141 patients). Post-vaccination geometric mean titres and seroprotection rates were also higher in high-dose vaccine recipients. There were no protocol-defined serious adverse events in the included trials in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly adults, the high-dose influenza vaccine was well-tolerated, more immunogenic, and more efficacious in preventing influenza infections than the standard-dose vaccine. Further pragmatic trials are needed to determine if the higher efficacy translates into higher vaccine effectiveness in adults over the age of 65.			2017				4834
Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer and dementia risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Nead, K. T., Sinha, S. and Nguyen, P. L.				prostate cancer and prostatic diseases	prostate cancer and prostatic diseases	BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to treat prostate cancer may be associated with an increased risk of dementia, but existing studies have shown conflicting results. Here we synthesize the literature on the association of ADT for the treatment of prostate cancer with dementia risk. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles reporting the outcome of dementia among individuals with prostate cancer in those exposed to ADT versus a lesser-exposed comparison group (for example, ADT versus no-ADT; continuous versus intermittent ADT) using PubMed (1966-present), Web of Science (1945-present), Embase (1966-present) and PsycINFO (1806-present). The search was undertaken on 4 December 2016 by two authors. We meta-analyzed studies reporting an effect estimate and controlling for confounding. Random- or fixed-effects meta-analytic models were used in the presence or absence of heterogeneity per the I(2) statistic, respectively. Small study effects were evaluated using Egger and Begg's tests. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the systematic review. Seven studies reported an adjusted effect estimate for dementia risk. A random-effects meta-analysis of studies reporting any dementia outcome, which included 50 541 individuals, showed an increased risk of dementia among ADT users (hazard ratio (HR), 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-2.00; P=0.02). We separately meta-analyzed studies reporting all-cause dementia (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.05-2.02; P<0.001) and Alzheimer's disease (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.99-1.57; P=0.06). There was no evidence of bias from small study effects (Egger, P=0.19; Begg, P=1.00). CONCLUSION: The currently available combined evidence suggests that ADT in the treatment of prostate cancer may be associated with an increased dementia risk. The potential for neurocognitive deficits secondary to ADT should be discussed with patients and evaluated prospectively.Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases advance online publication, 28 March 2017; doi:10.1038/pcan.2017.10.			2017				4326
The Effects of Pay-for-Performance Programs on Health, Health Care Use, and Processes of Care: A Systematic Review		Mendelson, A., Kondo, K., Damberg, C., Low, A., Motu'apuaka, M., Freeman, M., O'Neil, M., Relevo, R. and Kansagara, D.				annals of internal medicine	annals of internal medicine	BACKGROUND: The benefits of pay-for-performance (P4P) programs are uncertain. PURPOSE: To update and expand a prior review examining the effects of P4P programs targeted at the physician, group, managerial, or institutional level on process-of-care and patient outcomes in ambulatory and inpatient settings. DATA SOURCES: PubMed from June 2007 to October 2016; MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Business Economics and Theory, Business Source Elite, Scopus, Faculty of 1000, and Gartner Research from June 2007 to February 2016. STUDY SELECTION: Trials and observational studies in ambulatory and inpatient settings reporting process-of-care, health, or utilization outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators extracted data, assessed study quality, and graded the strength of the evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Among 69 studies, 58 were in ambulatory settings, 52 reported process-of-care outcomes, and 38 reported patient outcomes. Low-strength evidence suggested that P4P programs in ambulatory settings may improve process-of-care outcomes over the short term (2 to 3 years), whereas data on longer-term effects were limited. Many of the positive studies were conducted in the United Kingdom, where incentives were larger than in the United States. The largest improvements were seen in areas where baseline performance was poor. There was no consistent effect of P4P on intermediate health outcomes (low-strength evidence) and insufficient evidence to characterize any effect on patient health outcomes. In the hospital setting, there was low-strength evidence that P4P had little or no effect on patient health outcomes and a positive effect on reducing hospital readmissions. LIMITATION: Few methodologically rigorous studies; heterogeneous population and program characteristics and incentive targets. CONCLUSION: Pay-for-performance programs may be associated with improved processes of care in ambulatory settings, but consistently positive associations with improved health outcomes have not been demonstrated in any setting.

The impact of 10-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on hospitalization for pneumonia in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Alicino, C., Paganino, C., Orsi, A., Astengo, M., Trucchi, C., Icardi, G. and Ansaldi, F.				vaccine	vaccine	BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at summarizing available data on the impact of PCV10 and PCV13 in reducing the incidence of CAP hospitalizations in children aged <5years. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted. We included time-series analyses and before-after studies, reporting the incidence of hospitalization for pneumonia in the periods before and after the introduction of PCV10 or PCV13 into the immunization program. Pooled estimates of Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) were calculated by using a random-effects meta-analytic model. Results were stratified according to age-groups (<24months and 24-59months) and case definitions of pneumonia (clinically and radiologically confirmed pneumonia). RESULTS: A total of 1533 potentially relevant articles were identified. Of these, 12 articles were included in the analysis. In children aged <24months, the meta-analysis showed a reduction of 17% (95%CI: 11-22%, p-value<0.001) an of 31% (95%CI: 26-35%, p-value<0.001) in the hospitalization rates respectively for clinically and radiologically confirmed pneumonia, respectively, after the introduction of the novel PCVs. In children aged 24-59months, the meta-analysis showed a reduction of 9% (95%CI: 5-14%, p-value<0.001) and of 24% (95%CI: 12-33%, p-value<0.001) in the hospitalization rates for clinically and radiologically confirmed pneumonia, respectively, after the introduction of the novel PCVs. High heterogeneity was detected among studies evaluating the hospitalization rate for clinically and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed a significant impact of PCV10 and PCV13 in reducing the hospitalizations for pneumonia, particularly in children aged <24months and for radiologically confirmed disease. Further appropriately designed studies, comparing the impact of PCV10 and PCV13, are needed in order to obtain solid data on which to establish future immunization strategies.			2017				4594
Update of sarilumb to treat rheumatoid arthritis based on randomized clinical trials: a systematic review		Aly, A. M. and Furst, D. E.				expert review of clinical immunology	expert review of clinical immunology	INTRODUCTION: Sarilumab is a human monoclonal antibody against Interleukin 6 ? (IL-6?) receptor. Compared to tocilizumab, another IL-6 ? receptor antibody, sarilumab has a different structure and higher affinity. Areas Covered: In a systematic literature review, we examined all sarilumab randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in rheumatoid arthritis. The 6 reviewed RCTs included patients who were inadequate MTX, DMARD and/or TNFi responders. Sarilumab 150-200 mg every 2 weeks improved RA signs, symptoms, function and decreased radiological progression up to 52 weeks. The most common adverse events were infections and neutropenia, the latter of which will require careful observation in future trials. Examination of the effect of sero-positivity, disease duration, presence of erosions, use of previous biologic and comparisons to other biologics etc are still needed to complete understanding of this drug's profile. Long term studies, too, will be needed to assess long term tolerability Expert commentary: Results support the use of sarilumab to treat RA patients with inadequate response to MTX, other DMARDs and TNFis, although further studies are needed to fully assess its toxicity and understand the specific place of sarilumab in the RA armamentarium.			2017				4444
Systematic review of safeness and therapeutic efficacy of cannabis in patients with multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, and in oncological patients treated with chemotherapy		Amato, L., Minozzi, S., Mitrova, Z., Parmelli, E., Saulle, R., Cruciani, F., Vecchi, S. and Davoli, M.				epidemiologia e prevenzione	epidemiologia e prevenzione	BACKGROUND: medical cannabis refers to the use of cannabis or cannabinoids as medical therapy to treat disease or alleviate symptoms. In the United States, 23 states and Washington DC (May 2015) have introduced laws to permit the medical use of cannabis. Within the European Union, medicinal cannabis laws and praxis vary wildly between Countries. OBJECTIVES: to provide evidence for benefits and harms of cannabis (including extracts and tinctures) treatment for adults in the following indications: control of spasticity and pain in patients with multiple sclerosis; control of pain in patients with chronic neuropathic pain; control of nausea and vomiting in adults with cancer receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EMBASE from inception to September 2016. We also searched for on-going studies via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal. All searches included also non-English language literature. All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the safety and efficacy of cannabis (including extracts and tinctures) compared with placebo or other pharmacological agents were included. Three authors independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of studies identified in the literature searches for their eligibility. For studies considered eligible, we retrieved full texts. Three investigators independently extracted data. For the assessment of the quality of evidence, we used the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane and GRADE working Group. RESULTS: 41 trials (4,550 participants) were included; 15 studies considered efficacy and safety of cannabis for patients with multiple sclerosis, 12 for patients with chronic pain, and 14 for patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. The included studies were published between 1975 and 2015, and the majority of them were conducted in Europe. We judged almost 50% of these studies to be at low risk of bias. The large majority (80%) of the comparisons were with placebo; only 8 studies included patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy comparing cannabis with other antiemetic drugs. Concerning the efficacy of cannabis (compared with placebo) in patients with multiple sclerosis, confidence in the estimate was high in favour of cannabis for spasticity (numerical rating scale and visual analogue scale, but not the Ashworth scale) and pain. For chronic and neuropathic pain (compared with placebo), there was evidence of a small effect; however, confidence in the estimate is low and these results could not be considered conclusive. There is uncertainty whether cannabis, including extracts and tinctures, compared with placebo or other antiemetic drugs reduces nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer requiring chemotherapy, although the confidence in the estimate of the effect was low or very low. In the included studies, many adverse events were reported and none of the studies assessed the development of abuse or dependence. CONCLUSIONS: there is incomplete evidence of the efficacy and safety of medical use of cannabis in the clinical contexts considered in this review. Furthermore, for many of the outcomes considered, the confidence in the estimate of the effect was again low or very low. To give conclusive answers to the efficacy and safety of cannabis used for medical purposes in the clinical contexts considered, further studies are needed, with higher quality, larger sample sizes, and possibly using the same diagnostic tools for evaluating outcomes of interest.			2017				5129
Auditory Outcomes with Hearing Rehabilitation in Children with Unilateral Hearing Loss: A Systematic Review		Appachi, S., Specht, J. L., Raol, N., Lieu, J. E. C., Cohen, M. S., Dedhia, K. and Anne, S.				otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of american academy of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery	otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of american academy of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery	Objective Options for management of unilateral hearing loss (UHL) in children include conventional hearing aids, bone-conduction hearing devices, contralateral routing of signal (CROS) aids, and frequency-modulating (FM) systems. The objective of this study was to systematically review the current literature to characterize auditory outcomes of hearing rehabilitation options in UHL. Data Sources PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to January 2016. Manual searches of bibliographies were also performed. Review Methods Studies analyzing auditory outcomes of hearing amplification in children with UHL were included. Outcome measures included functional and objective auditory results. Two independent reviewers evaluated each abstract and article. Results Of the 249 articles identified, 12 met inclusion criteria. Seven articles solely focused on outcomes with bone-conduction hearing devices. Outcomes favored improved pure-tone averages, speech recognition thresholds, and sound localization in implanted patients. Five studies focused on FM systems, conventional hearing aids, or CROS hearing aids. Limited data are available but suggest a trend toward improvement in speech perception with hearing aids. FM systems were shown to have the most benefit for speech recognition in noise. Studies evaluating CROS hearing aids demonstrated variable outcomes. Conclusions Data evaluating functional and objective auditory measures following hearing amplification in children with UHL are limited. Most studies do suggest improvement in speech perception, speech recognition in noise, and sound localization with a hearing rehabilitation device.			2017				4902
Walking Aids for Enabling Activity and Participation: A Systematic Review		Bertrand, K., Raymond, M. H., Miller, W. C., Martin, G., Kathleen, A. and Demers, L.				american journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation	american journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation	In this systematic literature review, we examined whether and how walking aids (i.e., canes, crutches, walkers, and rollators) enable activity and participation among adults with physical disabilities. Medline, Embase, all EBM reviews, PsychInfo, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases were used to identify studies published since 2008. Quantitative and qualitative designs were included. Data regarding participants, assistive device use, outcome measures, and domains of participation were extracted. Two reviewers independently rated the level of evidence and methodological quality of the studies. Outcomes were categorized per types of walking aids and activity and participation domains. Thirteen studies were included. Two studies involved canes, four pertained to rollators, and seven dealt with multiple types of walking aids. Mobility was the most frequently examined domain of activity and participation. Both negative and positive results were found. Negative outcomes were linked to the physical characteristics of the device, the use, environment, and personal reluctance. When incorporated in daily life, walking aids were found to enable several domains of activity and participation. Whether walking aids facilitate activity and participation may depend on the user's ability to overcome obstacles and integrate them in daily life. More high-quality research is needed to draw conclusions about their effectiveness.			2017				4226
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug effect of denosumab on radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review of the literature		Boleto, G., Dramé, M., Lambrecht, I., Eschard, J. P. and Salmon, J. H.				clinical rheumatology	clinical rheumatology	The aim of this study was to evaluate the structural effect of denosumab on patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We performed a systematic review of the literature in the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov , and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. All studies evaluating the structural effect of denosumab on RA and meeting predefined criteria were included. Data regarding disease activity, progression of joint damage, joint space narrowing, and safety were recorded. Among 168 studies identified, only 4 were finally included in this review, involving a total of 687 patients. These 4 studies showed that denosumab is effective on joint damage at 6 and 12 months as compared to placebo, alendronate, and biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) alone. No effect was observed in terms of joint space narrowing, and DAS28 and HAQ scores remained unchanged. No case of osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical fracture was recorded, and safety was similar in both denosumab and control groups. Denosumab appears to be effective on joint erosion at 6 and 12 months in patients with RA meeting the ACR criteria, treated or not by a biologic, with excellent safety.			2017				4580
Escalated-dose somatostatin analogues for antiproliferative effect in GEPNETS: a systematic review		Chan, D. L., Ferone, D., Albertelli, M., Pavlakis, N., Segelov, E. and Singh, S.				endocrine	endocrine	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Somatostatin analogues are the cornerstone of systemic therapy for metastatic well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours for both hormonal control and antiproliferative effect. Dose escalation of somatostatin analogues is often utilized in clinical practice, but small studies have yielded mixed results. The aim of this study was to systematically determine the efficacy and safety of escalated-dose somatostatin analogues in the above setting. METHODS: Eligible trials (using more than 30?mg octreotide or 120?mg lanreotide/28 days) were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, other databases and conference proceedings. Demographics, disease control rate, objective response rate, biochemical response, improvement in symptoms and toxicity were abstracted. Trials were synthesized qualitatively. RESULTS: Eighteen studies (1002 patients) were identified. The risk of bias was moderate for objective response outcomes, but high for the outcomes of symptom control and toxicity due to open-label trial designs. Disease control rates ranged from 30 to 100%, but response rates were modest (at 0-14%). Rates of biochemical improvement (27-100%) and symptom improvement (23-100%) ranged widely depending on the population studied and the definition of response. The most common toxicities were fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort and cholelithiasis, with no severe or unexpected toxicities compared to standard-dose somatostatin analogues. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence indicates that escalated-dose somatostatin analogues are well-tolerated in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, with significant rates of disease control but low rates of tumour response. It was difficult to judge the exact rate of biochemical response or symptomatic improvement. There is a need for large, prospective studies investigating the role of escalated-dose somatostatin analogues in the treatment of metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.			2017				4831
Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Implantation: A Comprehensive Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of Observational Studies		Chatterjee, A., Bajaj, N. S., McMahon, W. S., Cribbs, M. G., White, J. S., Mukherjee, A. and Law, M. A.				journal of the american heart association	journal of the american heart association	BACKGROUND: Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation is approved for the treatment of dysfunctional right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduits. However, the literature is limited because of a small patient population, and it does not reflect changing procedural practice patterns over the last decade. METHODS AND RESULTS: A comprehensive search of Medline and Scopus databases from inception through August 31, 2016 was conducted using predefined criteria. We included studies reporting transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation in at least 5 patients with a follow-up duration of 6 months or more. In 19 eligible studies, 1044 patients underwent transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation with a pooled follow-up of 2271 person-years. Procedural success rate was 96.2% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 94.6-97.4) with a conduit rupture rate of 4.1% (95% CI, 2.5-6.8) and coronary complication rate of 1.3% (95% CI, 0.7-2.3). Incidence of reintervention was 4.4 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI, 3.0-5.9) with a marked reduction in studies reporting ?75% prestenting (2.9 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 1.5-4.3] versus 6.5/100 person-years [95% CI, 4.6-8.5]; P<0.01). Pooled endocarditis rate was 1.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 0.9-2.0). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides favorable updated estimates of procedural and follow-up outcomes after transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation. Widespread adoption of prestenting has improved longer-term outcomes in these patients.			2017				4901
Effect of pomalidomide on relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Chen, R., Wang, Y., Luan, C., Gao, C., Zhang, X. and Chen, B.				journal of cancer	journal of cancer	In this work, we aim to further analyze the effect of pomalidomide for relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). A systematic literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted on September 20, 2016. Pooled effect size (ES) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects model. STATA software (version 12.0; Stata Corporation; College Station, TX, USA) was employed to do all statistical analyses. A total of 8 studies were included for analysis. The combined results demonstrated that the pooled proportion of overall response rate (ORR) was 0.35 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.43, P=0.000), and the pooled proportion of complete response rate (CRR) was 0.02 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.03, P=0.541). Pomalidomide was generally well tolerated by patients reported in the studies. Further studies would be required to conduct more prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with larger samples to assess the proper place of pomalidomide as single agent or combined with other agents for RRMM.			2017				4825
Silver Diamine Fluoride Has Efficacy in Controlling Caries Progression in Primary Teeth: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Chibinski, A. C., Wambier, L. M., Feltrin, J., Loguercio, A. D., Wambier, D. S. and Reis, A.				caries research	caries research	"A systematic review was performed to evaluate the efficacy of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) in controlling caries progression in children when compared with active treatments or placebos. A search for randomized clinical trials that evaluate the effectiveness of SDF for caries control in children compared to active treatments or placebos with follow-ups longer than 6 months was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, BBO, Cochrane Library, and grey literature. The risk of bias tool from the Cochrane Collaboration was used for quality assessment of the studies. The quality of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Meta-analysis was performed on studies considered at low risk of bias. A total of 5,980 articles were identified. Eleven remained in the qualitative synthesis. Five studies were at ""low,"" 2 at ""unclear,"" and 4 studies at ""high"" risk of bias in the key domains. The studies from which the information could be extracted were included for meta-analysis. The arrestment of caries at 12 months promoted by SDF was 66% higher (95% CI 41-91%; p < 0.00001) than by other active material, but it was 154% higher (95% CI 67-85%; p < 0.00001) than by placebos. Overall, the caries arrestment was 89% higher (95% CI 49-138%; p < 0.00001) than using active materials/placebo. No heterogeneity was detected. The evidence was graded as high quality. The use of SDF is 89% more effective in controlling/arresting caries than other treatments or placebos. The quality of the evidence was graded as high."			2017				4634
Cannabinoids for spasticity due to multiple sclerosis or paraplegia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials		da Rovare, V. P., Magalhães, G. P. A., Jardini, G. D. A., Beraldo, M. L., Gameiro, M. O., Agarwal, A., Luvizutto, G. J., Paula-Ramos, L., Camargo, S. E. A., de Oliveira, L. D., Bazan, R. and El Dib, R.				complementary therapies in medicine	complementary therapies in medicine	OBJECTIVES: Spasticity remains highly prevalent in patients with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. To summarize the effects of cannabinoids compared with usual care, placebo for spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (MS) or paraplegia. METHODS: Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and LILACS to March 2017 were performed to identify randomized controlled trials. The primary outcomes were spasticity and spasm frequency. The criteria were any patient with MS and spasticity affecting upper or lower limbs or both, and that had a confirmed diagnosis of MS based on validated criteria, or however defined by the authors of the included studies. RESULTS: 16 trials including 2597 patients were eligible. Moderate-certainty evidence suggested a non-statistically significant decrease in spasticity (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.36 [confidential interval (CI) 95% -0.17 to 0.88; p=0.18; I2=88%]), and spasm frequency (SMD 0.04 [CI 95% -0.15 to 0.22]). There was an increase in adverse events such as dizziness (risk ratio (RR) 3.45 [CI 95% 2.71-4.4; p=0.20; I2=23%]), somnolence (RR 2.9 [CI 95% 1.98-4.23; p=0.77; I2=0%]), and nausea (RR 2.25 [CI 95% 1.62-3.13; p=0.83; I2=0%]). CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate certainty evidence regarding the impact of cannabinoids in spasticity (average 0.36 more spasticity; 0.17 fewer to 0.88 more) due to multiple sclerosis or paraplegia, and in adverse events such as dizziness (419 more dizziness/1000 over 19 weeks), somnolence (127 more somnolence/1000 over 19 weeks), and nausea (125 more somnolence/1000 over 19 weeks).			2017				5039
Do digital innovations for HIV and sexually transmitted infections work? Results from a systematic review (1996-2017)		Daher, J., Vijh, R., Linthwaite, B., Dave, S., Kim, J., Dheda, K., Peter, T. and Pai, N. P.				bmj open	bmj open	OBJECTIVE: Digital innovations with internet/mobile phones offer a potential cost-saving solution for overburdened health systems with high service delivery costs to improve efficiency of HIV/STI (sexually transmitted infections) control initiatives. However, their overall evidence has not yet been appraised. We evaluated the feasibility and impact of all digital innovations for all HIV/STIs. DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: All settings/all participants. INTERVENTION: We classified digital innovations into (1) mobile health-based (mHealth: SMS (short message service)/phone calls), (2) internet-based mobile and/or electronic health (mHealth/eHealth: social media, avatar-guided computer programs, websites, mobile applications, streamed soap opera videos) and (3) combined innovations (included both SMS/phone calls and internet-based mHealth/eHealth). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility, acceptability, impact. METHODS: We searched databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Web of Science, abstracted data, explored heterogeneity, performed a random effects subgroup analysis. RESULTS: We reviewed 99 studies, 63 (64%) were from America/Europe, 36 (36%) from Africa/Asia; 79% (79/99) were clinical trials; 84% (83/99) evaluated impact. Of innovations, mHealth based: 70% (69/99); internet based: 21% (21/99); combined: 9% (9/99).All digital innovations were highly accepted (26/31; 84%), and feasible (20/31; 65%). Regarding impacted measures, mHealth-based innovations (SMS) significantly improved antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence (pooled OR=2.15(95%CI: 1.18 to 3.91)) and clinic attendance rates (pooled OR=1.76(95%CI: 1.28, 2.42)); internet-based innovations improved clinic attendance (6/6), ART adherence (4/4), self-care (1/1), while reducing risk (5/5); combined innovations increased clinic attendance, ART adherence, partner notifications and self-care. Confounding (68%) and selection bias (66%) were observed in observational studies and attrition bias in 31% of clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Digital innovations were acceptable, feasible and generated impact. A trend towards the use of internet-based and combined (internet and mobile) innovations was noted. Large scale-up studies of high quality, with new integrated impact metrics, and cost-effectiveness are needed. Findings will appeal to all stakeholders in the HIV/STI global initiatives space.			2017				4549
Effect of specialist palliative care services on quality of life in adults with advanced incurable illness in hospital, hospice, or community settings: systematic review and meta-analysis		Gaertner, J., Siemens, W., Meerpohl, J. J., Antes, G., Meffert, C., Xander, C., Stock, S., Mueller, D., Schwarzer, G. and Becker, G.				bmj (clinical research ed.)	bmj (clinical research ed.)	Objective To assess the effect of specialist palliative care on quality of life and additional outcomes relevant to patients in those with advanced illness.Design Systematic review with meta-analysis.Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and trial registers searched up to July 2016.Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials with adult inpatients or outpatients treated in hospital, hospice, or community settings with any advanced illness. Minimum requirements for specialist palliative care included the multiprofessional team approach. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data, assessed the risk of bias (Cochrane risk of bias tool), and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE tool).Data synthesis Primary outcome was quality of life with Hedges' g as standardised mean difference (SMD) and random effects model in meta-analysis. In addition, the pooled SMDs of the analyses of quality of life were re-expressed on the global health/QoL scale (item 29 and 30, respectively) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 (0-100, high values=good quality of life, minimal clinically important difference 8.1).Results Of 3967 publications, 12 were included (10 randomised controlled trials with 2454 patients randomised, of whom 72% (n=1766) had cancer). In no trial was integration of specialist palliative care triggered according to patients' needs as identified by screening. Overall, there was a small effect in favour of specialist palliative care (SMD 0.16, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.31; QLQ-C30 global health/QoL 4.1, 0.3 to 8.2; n=1218, six trials). Sensitivity analysis showed an SMD of 0.57 (-0.02 to 1.15; global health/QoL 14.6, -0.5 to 29.4; n=1385, seven trials). The effect was marginally larger for patients with cancer (0.20, 0.01 to 0.38; global health/QoL 5.1, 0.3 to 9.7; n=828, five trials) and especially for those who received specialist palliative care early (0.33, 0.05 to 0.61, global health/QoL 8.5, 1.3 to 15.6; n=388, two trials). The results for pain and other secondary outcomes were inconclusive. Some methodological problems (such as lack of blinding) reduced the strength of the evidence.Conclusions Specialist palliative care was associated with a small effect on QoL and might have most pronounced effects for patients with cancer who received such care early. It could be most effective if it is provided early and if it identifies though screening those patients with unmet needs.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42015020674.			2017				4706
Adjuvant chemotherapy for resected biliary tract cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Ghidini, M., Tomasello, G., Botticelli, A., Barni, S., Zabbialini, G., Seghezzi, S., Passalacqua, R., Braconi, C. and Petrelli, F.				hpb : the official journal of the international hepato pancreato biliary association	hpb : the official journal of the international hepato pancreato biliary association	INTRODUCTION: The use of adjuvant treatment (AT) in resected biliary tract cancers (BTC) is still controversial. No efficacy comparison has been performed between chemotherapy (CT) and chemoradiotherapy (CTRT). A systematic review of the available evidence regarding adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) in resected BTC was performed. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS and The Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant articles published. Only studies including at least 50 patients affected by tumors of gallbladder, intrahepatic, perihilar, and distal bile ducts were considered. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Thirty studies were analyzed with a total of 22,499 patients, 3967 of whom received AC. Eleven cohorts included Western patients and 19 were Asiatic. Surgeries were classified as R0 with negative margins, R1 with positive microscopic and R2 with positive macroscopic margins. Weighted mean OS difference among experimental (AC) and control arm was 4.3 months (95% CI 0.88-7.79, P = 0.014). AC reduced the risk of death by 41% (Hazard ratio [HR] = 0.59, 95% CI 0.49-0.71; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: AC administration gives an OS benefit in resected BTC. The results of prospective randomized studies are awaited in order to define the standard AT in BTC.			2017				4437
A systematic literature review of cysteamine bitartrate in the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis		Goran, M., van der Weijden, M., Karabis, A. and Hemels, M.				current medical research and opinion	current medical research and opinion	OBJECTIVES: To summarize available clinical evidence for cysteamine bitartrate preparations in the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis as identified through a systematic literature review (SLR). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and EMBASE using Ovid® with a predefined search strategy through 19(th) January 2016. All publicly available clinical reports on the use of delayed-release (DR) cysteamine bitartrate (PROCYSBI®) or immediate-release (IR) cysteamine bitartrate (Cystagon®) in patients with cystinosis were included. RESULTS: We identified a total of 103 publications and 10 trial records. Of these, 9 studies describe DR cysteamine bitartrate (n?=?267 patients), 42 describe IR cysteamine bitartrate (n?=?1,427 patients) and in 53 studies the exact preparation was not specified (n?=?906 patients). The vast majority of the studies used a non-randomized study design, with randomized clinical trials (RCTs) being scarce (1 study comparing DR and IR formulation) and case reports (n= 49) being the most common study design representing 47% of the total. CONCLUSION: A substantial evidence base for cysteamine bitartrate in the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis was identified. However, the majority of the evidence was of relatively low quality, with evidence levels of 3 or 4.			2017				4457
Mood stabilizers in pregnancy and child developmental outcomes: A systematic review		Haskey, C. and Galbally, M.				the australian and new zealand journal of psychiatry	the australian and new zealand journal of psychiatry	BACKGROUND: Research suggests that maintaining treatment during pregnancy for women with bipolar affective disorder reduces the risk of relapse. However, one of the key questions for women and clinicians during pregnancy is whether there are implications of exposure to mood stabilizers for longer term child development. Despite these concerns, there are few recent systematic reviews comparing the impact on child developmental outcomes for individual mood-stabilizing agents to inform clinical decisions. OBJECTIVES: To examine the strengths and limitations of the existing data on child developmental outcomes following prenatal exposure to mood stabilizers and to explore whether there are any differences between agents for detrimental effects on child development. METHOD: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a rigorous systematic search was carried out of four electronic databases from their respective years of inception to September 2016 to identify studies which examined the effects of mood stabilizers including sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, lithium and second-generation antipsychotics on child developmental outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 15 studies for critical review. Of these, 10 examined antiepileptic drugs, 2 studied lithium and 3 studied second-generation antipsychotics. The most consistent finding was a dose-response relationship for valproate with higher doses associated with poorer global cognitive abilities compared to other antiepileptic drugs. The limited data available for lithium found no adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. The limited second-generation antipsychotic studies included a report of a transient early neurodevelopmental delay which resolved by 12?months of age. CONCLUSION: This review found higher neurodevelopmental risk with valproate. While the existing data on lithium and second-generation antipsychotics are reassuring, these data are both limited and lower quality, indicating that further research is required. The information from this review is relevant for patients and clinicians to influence choice of mood-stabilizing agent in childbearing women. This must be balanced against the known risks associated with untreated bipolar affective disorder.			2017				4261
Comparative efficacy and safety of reperfusion therapy with fibrinolytic agents in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a systematic review and network meta-analysis		Jinatongthai, P., Kongwatcharapong, J., Foo, C. Y., Phrommintikul, A., Nathisuwan, S., Thakkinstian, A., Reid, C. M. and Chaiyakunapruk, N.				lancet (london, england)	lancet (london, england)	BACKGROUND: Fibrinolytic therapy offers an alternative to mechanical reperfusion for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in settings where health-care resources are scarce. Comprehensive evidence comparing different agents is still unavailable. In this study, we examined the effects of various fibrinolytic drugs on clinical outcomes. METHODS: We did a network meta-analysis based on a systematic review of randomised controlled trials comparing fibrinolytic drugs in patients with STEMI. Several databases were searched from inception up to Feb 28, 2017. We included only randomised controlled trials that compared fibrinolytic agents as a reperfusion therapy in adult patients with STEMI, whether given alone or in combination with adjunctive antithrombotic therapy, against other fibrinolytic agents, a placebo, or no treatment. Only trials investigating agents with an approved indication of reperfusion therapy in STEMI (streptokinase, tenecteplase, alteplase, and reteplase) were included. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality within 30-35 days and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016042131). FINDINGS: A total of 40 eligible studies involving 128?071 patients treated with 12 different fibrinolytic regimens were assessed. Compared with accelerated infusion of alteplase with parenteral anticoagulants as background therapy, streptokinase and non-accelerated infusion of alteplase were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 1·14 [95% CI 1·05-1·24] for streptokinase plus parenteral anticoagulants; RR 1·26 [1·10-1·45] for non-accelerated alteplase plus parenteral anticoagulants). No significant difference in mortality risk was recorded between accelerated infusion of alteplase, tenecteplase, and reteplase with parenteral anticoagulants as background therapy. For major bleeding, a tenecteplase-based regimen tended to be associated with lower risk of bleeding compared with other regimens (RR 0·79 [95% CI 0·63-1·00]). The addition of glycoprotein IIb or IIIa inhibitors to fibrinolytic therapy increased the risk of major bleeding by 1·27-8·82-times compared with accelerated infusion alteplase plus parenteral anticoagulants (RR 1·47 [95% CI 1·10-1·98] for tenecteplase plus parenteral anticoagulants plus glycoprotein inhibitors; RR 1·88 [1·24-2·86] for reteplase plus parenteral anticoagulants plus glycoprotein inhibitors). INTERPRETATION: Significant differences exist among various fibrinolytic regimens as reperfusion therapy in STEMI and alteplase (accelerated infusion), tenecteplase, and reteplase should be considered over streptokinase and non-accelerated infusion of alteplase. The addition of glycoprotein IIb or IIIa inhibitors to fibrinolytic therapy should be discouraged. FUNDING: None.			2017				4751
Vision Screening in Children Aged 6 Months to 5 Years: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force		Jonas, D. E., Amick, H. R., Wallace, I. F., Feltner, C., Vander Schaaf, E. B., Brown, C. L. and Baker, C.				jama	jama	IMPORTANCE: Preschool vision screening could allow detection and treatment of vision abnormalities during a critical developmental stage, preserving function and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence on screening for and treatment of amblyopia, its risk factors, and refractive error in children aged 6 months to 5 years to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and trial registries through June 2016; references; and experts, with surveillance of the literature through June 7, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or prospective cohort studies that evaluated screening, studies evaluating test accuracy, RCTs of treatment vs inactive controls, and cohort studies or case-control studies assessing harms. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings. Studies were not quantitatively pooled because of clinical and methodological heterogeneity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Visual acuity, amblyopia, school performance, functioning, quality of life, test accuracy, testability, and harms. RESULTS: Forty studies were included (N?=?34?709); 34 evaluated test accuracy. No RCTs compared screening with no screening, and no studies evaluated school performance, function, or quality of life. Studies directly assessing earlier or more intensive screening were limited by high attrition. Positive likelihood ratios were between 5 and 10 for amblyopia risk factors or nonamblyogenic refractive error in most studies of test accuracy and were greater than 10 in most studies evaluating combinations of clinical tests. Inability to cooperate may limit use of some tests in children younger than 3 years. Studies with low prevalence (<10%) of vision abnormalities showed high false-positive rates (usually >75%). Among children with amblyopia risk factors (eg, strabismus or anisometropia), patching improved visual acuity of the amblyopic eye by a mean of less than 1 line on a standard chart after 5 to 12 weeks for children pretreated with glasses (2 RCTs, 240 participants); more children treated with patching than with no patching experienced improvement of at least 2 lines (45% vs 21%; P?=?.003; 1 RCT, 180 participants). Patching plus glasses improved visual acuity by about 1 line after 1 year (0.11 logMAR [95% CI, 0.05-0.17]) for children not pretreated with glasses (1 RCT, 177 participants). Glasses alone improved visual acuity by less than 1 line after 1 year (0.08 logMAR [95% CI, 0.02-0.15], 1 RCT, 177 participants). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Studies directly evaluating the effectiveness of screening were limited and do not establish whether vision screening in preschool children is better than no screening. Indirect evidence supports the utility of multiple screening tests for identifying preschool children at higher risk for vision problems and the effectiveness of some treatments for improving visual acuity outcomes.			2017				5114
Quality of Life Outcomes after Primary Treatment for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review		Lardas, M., Liew, M., van den Bergh, R. C., De Santis, M., Bellmunt, J., Van den Broeck, T., Cornford, P., Cumberbatch, M. G., Fossati, N., Gross, T., Henry, A. M., Bolla, M., Briers, E., Joniau, S., Lam, T. B., Mason, M. D., Mottet, N., van der Poel, H. G., Rouvière, O., Schoots, I. G., Wiegel, T., Willemse, P. M., Yuan, C. Y. and Bourke, L.				european urology	european urology	CONTEXT: Current evidence-based management for clinically localised prostate cancer includes active surveillance, surgery, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. The impact of these treatment modalities on quality of life (QoL) is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review comparative studies investigating disease-specific QoL outcomes as assessed by validated cancer-specific patient-reported outcome measures with at least 1 yr of follow-up after primary treatment for clinically localised prostate cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library were searched to identify relevant studies. Studies were critically appraised for the risk of bias. A narrative synthesis was undertaken. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of 11486 articles identified, 18 studies were eligible for inclusion, including three randomised controlled trials (RCTs; follow-up range: 60-72 mo) and 15 nonrandomised comparative studies (follow-up range: 12-180 mo) recruiting a total of 13604 patients. Two RCTs recruited small cohorts and only one was judged to have a low risk of bias. The quality of evidence from observational studies was low to moderate. For a follow-up of up to 6 yr, active surveillance was found to have the lowest impact on cancer-specific QoL, surgery had a negative impact on urinary and sexual function when compared with active surveillance and EBRT, and EBRT had a negative impact on bowel function when compared with active surveillance and surgery. Data from one small RCT reported that brachytherapy has a negative impact on urinary function 1 yr post-treatment, but no significant urinary toxicity was reported at 5 yr. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic review comparing the impact of different primary treatments on cancer-specific QoL for men with clinically localised prostate cancer, using validated cancer-specific patient-reported outcome measures only. There is robust evidence that choice of primary treatment for localised prostate cancer has distinct impacts on patients' QoL. This should be discussed in detail with patients during pretreatment counselling. PATIENT SUMMARY: Our review of the current evidence suggests that for a period of up to 6 yr after treatment, men with localised prostate cancer who were managed with active surveillance reported high levels of quality of life (QoL). Men treated with surgery reported mainly urinary and sexual problems, while those treated with external beam radiotherapy reported mainly bowel problems. Men eligible for brachytherapy reported urinary problems up to a year after therapy, but then their QoL returned gradually to as it was before treatment.			2017				4480
Efficacy of dexmedetomidine for pain management in knee arthroscopy: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Li, C. and Qu, J.				medicine	medicine	BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine showed some potential in pain control in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy. METHODS: We searched the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of dexmedetomidine on knee arthroscopy in PubMed, EMbase, Web of science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases. The primary outcome was pain scores. Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effect model. RESULTS: Five RCTs were included. Overall, compared with control intervention in patients with knee arthroscopy, dexmedetomidine intervention could significantly reduce the pain scores [Std. mean difference?=?-0.84; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)?=?-1.24 to -0.44; P?<?.0001] and postoperative diclofenac sodium consumption (Std. mean difference?=?-1.76; 95% CI?=?-3.32 to -0.21; P?=?.03), improve duration of analgesic effect (Std. mean difference?=?1.78; 95% CI?=?0.56-3.00; P?=?.004), but showed no influence on hypotension [risk ratio (RR)?=?0.93; 95% CI?=?0.14-5.92; P?=?.94], bradycardia (RR?=?4.93; 95% CI?=?0.91-26.58; P?=?.06), nausea, and vomiting (RR?=?1.96; 95% CI?=?0.31-12.58; P?=?.48). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine intervention was able to significantly reduce the pain scores and postoperative diclofenac sodium consumption, and improve duration of analgesic effect in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy, but had no influence on hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting.			2017				4459
Effect of ALK-inhibitors in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Li, G., Dai, W. R. and Shao, F. C.				european review for medical and pharmacological sciences	european review for medical and pharmacological sciences	OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Over 80% of all lung cancer cases are non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and approximately 5% of NSCLC patients are positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement or fusion with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4). NSCLC patients with positive ALK-EML4 gene fusion are highly sensitive to ALK-inhibitors. While the efficacy of the ALK-inhibitors in the treatment of NSCLC has been consistently reported, a limited number of randomized, large-scale clinical trials have been reported. The current study was, therefore, designed to systematically review and appraise current knowledge and conduct a meta-analysis on phase I, II, and III clinical trials in which ALK-inhibitors were used to treat NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed online database was thoroughly searched. A total of 26 articles were included in a qualitative systematic review, and four of them were used to conduct the quantitative meta-analysis. RESULTS: We found that ALK inhibitors significantly improved the overall survival (OS) and progress free survival (PFS) of NSCLC patients, especially of ALK or ROS1 gene fusion-positive cases. ALK inhibitors contributed to better therapeutic outcomes regarding increased one-year and two-year OS, PFS, and ORR (Odds ratio: 4.393, 95% CI: 3.302-5.845, p < 0.001). Visual disturbance was the most common side effect observed in the patients treated with crizotinib, whereas mild gastrointestinal reactions, such as diarrhea and nausea, were most frequent in the patients treated with the 2nd generation of ALK inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: ALK inhibitors are safe and effective in the treatment of NSCLC patients, especially those with positive ALK-EML4 gene fusion or rearrangement.			2017				4405
Efficacy and Safety of Adjuvant Treatment with Entacapone in Advanced Parkinson's Disease with Motor Fluctuation: A Systematic Meta-Analysis		Li, J., Lou, Z., Liu, X., Sun, Y. and Chen, J.				european neurology	european neurology	AIMS: To assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant treatment with entacapone in the treatment of later Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with motor fluctuation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of relevant studies from 8 databases to June 23, 2016. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review (n = 2,804). The results showed that compared with placebo, adjuvant therapy with entacapone significantly increased on time (p < 0.01) and reduced off time (p < 0.01), the required levodopa (LD) dose (p < 0.01) and improved Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores (activities of daily living score: p < 0.01; motor score: p < 0.01; UPDRS I-III score: p > 0.05). However, the withdrawal (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.10-1.89, p < 0.01) due to adverse events and adverse events rates including nausea (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.56-3.20, p < 0.01), urine discoloration (OR 14.99, 95% CI 7.63-29.44, p < 0.01), gastrointestinal disorder (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.89-3.57, p < 0.01) and dyskinesia (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.56-2.58, p < 0.01) increased in patients with entacapone compared with those given a placebo . CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the entacapone used as adjuvant therapy to LD is effective in the management of later PD with fluctuation. However, patients on entacapone had a higher frequency of adverse events than those on placebo but no occurrence of severe adverse reactions.			2017				5166
Effects of protein supplementation combined with resistance exercise on body composition and physical function in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Liao, C. D., Tsauo, J. Y., Wu, Y. T., Cheng, C. P., Chen, H. C., Huang, Y. C., Chen, H. C. and Liou, T. H.				the american journal of clinical nutrition	the american journal of clinical nutrition	Background: Overweight and obese older people face a high risk of muscle loss and impaired physical function, which may contribute to sarcopenic obesity. Resistance exercise training (RET) has a beneficial effect on muscle protein synthesis and can be augmented by protein supplementation (PS). However, whether body weight affects the augmentation of muscular and functional performance in response to PS in older people undergoing RET remains unclear.Objective: This study was conducted to identify the effects of PS on the body composition and physical function of older people undergoing RET.Design: We performed a comprehensive search of online databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the efficacy of PS for lean mass gain, strength gain, and physical mobility improvements in older people undergoing RET.Results: We included 17 RCTs; the overall mean ± SD age and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) in these RCTs were 73.4 ± 8.1 y and 29.7 ± 5.5, respectively. The participants had substantially greater lean mass and leg strength gains when PS and RET were used than with RET alone, with the standard mean differences (SMDs) being 0.58 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.84) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.98), respectively. The subgroup of studies with a mean BMI ?30 exhibited substantially greater lean mass (SMD: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.87) and leg strength (SMD: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.42, 1.34) gains in response to PS. The subgroup of studies with a mean BMI <30 also exhibited relevant gains in response to PS.Conclusions: Compared with RET alone, PS combined with RET may have a stronger effect in preventing aging-related muscle mass attenuation and leg strength loss in older people, which was found in studies with a mean BMI ?30 and in studies with a mean BMI <30. Clinicians could use nutrition supplement and exercise strategies, especially PS plus RET, to effectively improve the physical activity and health status of all older patients.			2017				5128
A Systematic Review of the Effectiveness of Medical Cannabis for Psychiatric, Movement and Neurodegenerative Disorders		Lim, K., See, Y. M. and Lee, J.				clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the korean college of neuropsychopharmacology	clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the korean college of neuropsychopharmacology	The discovery of endocannabinoid's role within the central nervous system and its potential therapeutic benefits have brought forth rising interest in the use of cannabis for medical purposes. The present review aimed to synthesize and evaluate the available evidences on the efficacy of cannabis and its derivatives for psychiatric, neurodegenerative and movement disorders. A systematic search of randomized controlled trials of cannabis and its derivatives were conducted via databases (PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). A total of 24 reports that evaluated the use of medical cannabis for Alzheimer's disease, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, dementia, dystonia, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychosis and Tourette syndrome were included in this review. Trial quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. There is a lack of evidence on the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and dystonia. Although trials with positive findings were identified for anorexia nervosa, anxiety, PTSD, psychotic symptoms, agitation in Alzheimer's disease and dementia, Huntington's disease, and Tourette syndrome, and dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease, definitive conclusion on its efficacy could not be drawn. Evaluation of these low-quality trials, as rated on the Cochrane risk of bias tools, was challenged by methodological issues such as inadequate description of allocation concealment, blinding and underpowered sample size. More adequately powered controlled trials that examine the long and short term efficacy, safety and tolerability of cannabis for medical use, and the mechanisms underpinning the therapeutic potential are warranted.			2017				4369
Association of androgen deprivation therapy and depression in the treatment of prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Nead, K. T., Sinha, S., Yang, D. D. and Nguyen, P. L.				urologic oncology	urologic oncology	BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may be associated with depression. Existing studies have shown conflicting results. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycINFO were queried on April 5, 2017. Eligible studies were in English and reported depression among individuals with prostate cancer exposed to a course of ADT vs. a lesser-exposed group (e.g., any-ADT vs. no ADT and continuous ADT vs. intermittent ADT). We used the MOOSE statement guidelines and the Cochrane Review Group's data extraction template. Study quality was evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to calculate summary statistic risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I(2) statistic and prespecified subgroup analysis. Small study effects were evaluated using Begg and Egger statistics. RESULTS: A total of 1,128 studies were initially identified and evaluated. A meta-analysis of 18 studies among 168,756 individuals found that ADT use conferred a 41% increased risk of depression (RR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.18-1.70; P<0.001). We found a consistent strong statistically significant association when limiting our analysis to studies in localized disease (RR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.20-2.85; P = 0.005) and those using a clinical diagnosis of depression (RR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.08-1.32; P = 0.001). We did not find an association for continuous ADT with depression risk compared to intermittent ADT (RR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.50-1.99; P = 0.992). There was no statistically significant evidence of small study effects. Statistically significant heterogeneity in the full analysis (I(2) = 80%; 95% CI: 69-87; P<0.001) resolved when examining studies using a clinical diagnosis of depression (I(2) = 16%; 95% CI: 0-60; P = 0.310). CONCLUSION: The currently available evidence suggests that ADT in the treatment of prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of depression.			2017				5061
Mandibular complete denture versus single-implant overdenture: a systematic review of patient-reported outcomes		Nogueira, T. E., Dias, D. R. and Leles, C. R.				journal of oral rehabilitation	journal of oral rehabilitation	"The single-implant mandibular overdenture (SIMO) has been proposed as an alternative for edentulous patients who are poorly adapted to their dentures due to low retention and stability of the conventional mandibular complete denture (CD). However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of SIMO, which can be measured by examining patient perception of treatment effects. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the comparative results of CD and SIMO treatments by using patient-reported outcome measures. A literature search was carried out in PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Central databases. The search included studies published up to July 2017. The focus question was: ""Do single-implant mandibular overdentures improve patient-reported outcomes compared to conventional complete dentures in edentulous patients?"" Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials (RCT) and prospective studies. After initial screening for eligibility and full-text analysis, 11 studies were included for data extraction and quality assessment (five parallel-group RCTs, two crossover RCTs, and four prospective studies). All studies reported marked improvement in satisfaction with the dentures and quality-of-life measures after SIMO treatment, irrespective of variations in implant-treatment protocols and retention systems. Methodological considerations revealed a lack of evidence from RCTs on the comparative effectiveness of the two treatment strategies. Hence, although available evidence suggests considerable improvement in patient-reported outcomes following the insertion of a single implant to retain a mandibular denture, further well-designed comparative studies between SIMO and CD are required to improve the level of evidence and to support the indication of SIMO treatment in routine practice.

Benefits and Harms of Plant-Based Cannabis for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Systematic Review		O'Neil, M. E., Nugent, S. M., Morasco, B. J., Freeman, M., Low, A., Kondo, K., Zakher, B., Elven, C., Motu'apuaka, M., Paynter, R. and Kansagara, D.				annals of internal medicine	annals of internal medicine	BACKGROUND: Cannabis is available from medical dispensaries for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in many states of the union, yet its efficacy in treating PTSD symptoms remains uncertain. PURPOSE: To identify ongoing studies and review existing evidence regarding the benefits and harms of plant-based cannabis preparations in treating PTSD in adults. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and other sources from database inception to March 2017. STUDY SELECTION: English-language systematic reviews, trials, and observational studies with a control group that reported PTSD symptoms and adverse effects of plant-based cannabis use in adults with PTSD. DATA EXTRACTION: Study data extracted by 1 investigator was checked by a second reviewer; 2 reviewers independently assessed study quality, and the investigator group graded the overall strength of evidence by using standard criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two systematic reviews, 3 observational studies, and no randomized trials were found. The systematic reviews reported insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about benefits and harms. The observational studies found that compared with nonuse, cannabis did not reduce PTSD symptoms. Studies had medium and high risk of bias, and overall evidence was judged insufficient. Two randomized trials and 6 other studies examining outcomes of cannabis use in patients with PTSD are ongoing and are expected to be completed within 3 years. LIMITATION: Very scant evidence with medium to high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the benefits and harms of plant-based cannabis preparations in patients with PTSD, but several ongoing studies may soon provide important results.

Management of Treatment-Resistant Panic Disorder		Perna, G. and Caldirola, D.				current treatment options in psychiatry	current treatment options in psychiatry	"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Purpose of Review Management of treatment-resistant (TR) panic disorder (PD) is an unresolved issue. In this paper, we provide a brief summary of previous findings, an updated (2015-2017) systematic review of pharmacological/non-pharmacological studies, and our personal perspective on this topic. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent Findings We found a very limited number of recent findings. Quetiapine extended-release augmentation has not been found to be beneficial, in comparison to placebo, in non-responders to previously recommended pharmacotherapy. In non-responders to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), switching to paroxetine/citalopram has been found to be more effective than continuing CBT. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has shown some improvement in patients' resistance to previous psychological/pharmacological interventions compared with a waiting-list condition. SUMMARY: Summary Previous and recent findings regarding the treatment of TR PD suffer from several methodological limitations. Available studies provide insufficient evidence to support the use of medications alternative to the recommended medications; the efficacy of ACT needs confirmation with more rigorous methodology. Prolonged pharmacotherapy may produce significant improvement in patients with unsatisfactory response to short-term pharmacotherapy, while switching to pharmacotherapy may help non-responders to CBT. We discuss our personal perspective on the definition of ""treatment resistance"" as it relates to PD and provide personalized intervention strategies to increase favorable clinical outcomes based on our clinical expertise and review of experimental studies on the pathophysiology of PD."			2017				5148
Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors for Improving Renal Function in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Pisano, A., Cernaro, V., Gembillo, G., D'Arrigo, G., Buemi, M. and Bolignano, D.				international journal of molecular sciences	international journal of molecular sciences	BACKGROUND: Accruing evidence suggests that Xanthine Oxidase inhibitors (XOis) may bring direct renal benefits, besides those related to their hypo-uricemic effect. We hence aimed at performing a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to verify if treatment with XOis may improve renal outcomes in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Ovid-MEDLINE, PubMed and CENTRAL databases were searched for RCTs comparing any XOi to standard therapy or placebo. The primary endpoint of interest was progression to End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD); secondary endpoints were changes in serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria and albuminuria. RESULTS: XOis treatment significantly reduced the risk of ESKD compared to the control (3 studies, 204 pts; RR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22, 0.80) and also improved eGFR in data pooled from RCTs with long follow-up times (>3 mo.) (4 studies, 357 pts; mean difference (MD) 6.82 mL/min/1.73 m²; 95% CI, 3.50, 10.15) and high methodological quality (blind design) (3 studies, 400 pts; MD 2.61 mL/min/1.73 m²; 95% CI, 0.23, 4.99). Conversely, no definite effects were apparently noticed on serum creatinine, proteinuria and albuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: XOis may represent a promising tool for retarding disease progression in CKD patients. Future trials are awaited to confirm the generalizability of these findings to the whole CKD population.			2017				4617
Renal cell carcinoma: alternative nephron-sparing treatment options for small renal masses, a systematic review		Prins, F. M., Kerkmeijer, L. G. W., Pronk, A. A., Vonken, E. P. A., Meijer, R. P., Bex, A. and Barendrecht, M. M.				journal of endourology	journal of endourology	<i>Background</i> The standard treatment of T1 renal cell carcinoma is (partial-) nephrectomy. For patients where surgery is not the treatment of choice, for example in the elderly, in case of severe comorbidity, inoperability or refusal of surgery, alternative treatment options are available. These treatment options include active surveillance, radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, microwave ablation or stereotactic body radiotherapy. In the present overview, the efficacy, safety and outcome of these different options are summarized, particularly focusing on recent developments. <i>Methods and Materials</i> Databases of Medline (via PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. The search was performed in December 2016, and included a search period from 2010-2016. The terms and synonyms used were renal cell carcinoma, active surveillance, radiofrequency, microwave ablation, cryoablation and stereotactic body radiotherapy. <i>Results</i> The database search identified 2806 records, in total 73 articles were included to assess the rationale and clinical evidence of alternative treatment modalities for small renal masses. The methodological quality of the included articles varied between level 2b and level 4. <i>Conclusion</i> Alternative treatment modalities such as AS, RFA, CA, MWA and SBRT are treatment options especially for those patients who are unfit to undergo an invasive treatment. There are no RCT's available comparing surgery and less invasive modalities, leading to a low quality on the reported articles. A Case-controlled registry might be an alternative to compare outcomes non-invasive treatment modalities in the future.			2017				4827
Oral health-related quality of life in subjects with implant-supported prostheses: A systematic review		Reissmann, D. R., Dard, M., Lamprecht, R., Struppek, J. and Heydecke, G.				journal of dentistry	journal of dentistry	OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to review the current literature relating to the impact of dental implants on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in edentulous or partially dentate patients. DATA/SOURCES: Systematic literature searches were performed in the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases, using high level MeSH terms. The searches were limited to studies published in English from 1960 to June 11, 2017, reporting OHRQoL outcomes using validated instruments, and having enrolled at least 50 patients. STUDY SELECTION: After removal of duplicates, a total of 2,827 unique hits were identified. After title, abstract, and full text screening, 63 articles were included in the review presenting findings of 55 individual studies. The provision of implant-supported dentures was associated with a significant increase in OHRQoL in partially dentate and in edentulous patients, with the magnitude of achieved improvement typically being greater for implant-supported dentures than with conventional ones. Furthermore, OHRQoL impairment prior to treatment was strongly associated with OHRQoL improvement. CONCLUSION: For partially dentate patients, there is not enough evidence that implant-supported FDP are superior in terms of OHRQoL than conventional FDP, but moderate evidence suggests that implant-supported FDP perform better than conventional RDP. In edentulous patients, evidence suggests that only if OHRQoL at baseline is highly impaired and patients request implant treatment, IOD are superior than CD in terms of treatment-induced OHRQoL improvement. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Patients can be informed that implant treatment is usually related to a significant improvement in OHRQoL. However, improvement is not necessarily higher than for conventional prosthodontic treatments but depends on patient's clinical and psychosocial characteristics.			2017				4399
Open treatment of unilateral mandibular condyle fractures in adults: a systematic review		Rozeboom, A., Dubois, L., Bos, R., Spijker, R. and de Lange, J.				international journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery	international journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery	Since the introduction of rigid internal fixation devices, more and more surgeons favour an open approach to treating condylar fractures of the mandible in adult patients. Different indications for open treatment have been published. Open treatment is associated with surgical complications because of the technique employed. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of the studies published exclusively on open treatment, and to summarize the existing open treatment modalities and their clinical outcomes. A total of seventy studies were selected for detailed analysis. Most studies reported good results with regard to the outcome measures of open treatment. Surgical complications including hematoma, wound infection, weakness of the facial nerve, sialocele, salivary fistula, sensory disturbance of the great auricular nerve, unsatisfactory scarring, and fixation failure were reported in the studies. This review suggests that because of the high level of methodological variance in the relevant studies published to date, among other factors, there are currently no evidence-based conclusions or guidelines that can be formulated with regard to the most appropriate open treatment. Establishment of such standards could potentially improve treatment outcomes.			2017				4347
Subgroup analyses of the effectiveness of oral glucosamine for knee and hip osteoarthritis: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis from the OA trail bank		Runhaar, J., Rozendaal, R. M., Middelkoop, M. V., Bijlsma, H. J. W., Doherty, M., Dziedzic, K. S., Lohmander, L. S., McAlindon, T., Zhang, W. and Bierma Zeinstra, S.				annals of the rheumatic diseases	annals of the rheumatic diseases	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of oral glucosamine in subgroups of people with hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA) based on baseline pain severity, body mass index (BMI), sex, structural abnormalities and presence of inflammation using individual patient data. METHODS: After a systematic search of the literature and clinical trial registries, all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of any oral glucosamine substance in patients with clinically or radiographically defined hip or knee OA were contacted. As a minimum, pain, age, sex and BMI at baseline and pain as an outcome measure needed to be assessed. RESULTS: Of 21 eligible studies, six (n=1663) shared their trial data with the OA Trial Bank. Five trials (all independent of industry, n=1625) compared glucosamine with placebo, representing 55% of the total number of participants in all published placebo-controlled RCTs. Glucosamine was no better than placebo for pain or function at short (3 months) and long-term (24 months) follow-up. Glucosamine was also no better than placebo among the predefined subgroups. Stratification for knee OA and type of glucosamine did not alter these results. CONCLUSIONS: Although proposed and debated for several years, open trial data are not widely made available for studies of glucosamine for OA, especially those sponsored by industry. Currently, there is no good evidence to support the use of glucosamine for hip or knee OA and an absence of evidence to support specific consideration of glucosamine for any clinically relevant OA subgroup according to baseline pain severity, BMI, sex, structural abnormalities or presence of inflammation.			2017				5101
Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials		Sadeghirad, B., Siemieniuk, R. A. C., Brignardello-Petersen, R., Papola, D., Lytvyn, L., Vandvik, P. O., Merglen, A., Guyatt, G. H. and Agoritsas, T.				bmj (clinical research ed.)	bmj (clinical research ed.)	Objective To estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat.Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials.Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, reference lists of eligible trials, related reviews.Study selection Randomised controlled trials of the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.Review methods Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. Random effects model was used for meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.Results 10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received single low dose corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality). The mean time to onset of pain relief in patients treated with corticosteroids was 4.8 hours earlier (95% confidence interval -1.9 to -7.8; moderate quality) and the mean time to complete resolution of pain was 11.1 hours earlier (-0.4 to -21.8; low quality) than in those treated with placebo. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours (visual analogue scale 0-10) was greater in patients treated with corticosteroids (mean difference 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; moderate quality). Nine of the 10 trials sought information regarding adverse events. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported few adverse events, which were mostly complications related to disease, with a similar incidence in both groups.Conclusion Single low dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Included trials did not assess the potential risks of larger cumulative doses in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42017067808.			2017				4283
Efficacy of adding nutritional supplements in unipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Schefft, C., Kilarski, L. L., Bschor, T. and Köhler, S.				european neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the european college of neuropsychopharmacology	european neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the european college of neuropsychopharmacology	"In this article, we aimed to assess the efficacy of adjunctive administration of nutritional supplements to antidepressants by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis. The supplements included were inositol, vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin B12, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and zinc. A structured database search (MEDLINE, EBSCO, CENTRAL, Web of Science) was performed using terms for the respective substances in conjunction with terms for depression and the mode of treatment (""add-on"" OR ""adjunctive"" OR ""augmentation""). Meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized comparative studies that investigated the supplements as an add-on in the treatment of clinically diagnosed MDD were included. Agents had to be added to an existing antidepressant regime (augmentation) or started simultaneously with the antidepressant (acceleration). For n-3 PUFAs, folic acid and zinc, new meta-analyses were performed as part of this work. Our meta-analyses of 10 articles on n-3 PUFAs and four on zinc support their efficacy. For folic acid, our meta-analysis does not support efficacy. For n-3 PUFAs, sensitivity analysis showed no difference between acceleration and augmentation designs, but significant differences between individuals with or without comorbidities. For the remaining substances, only a few RCTs were available. The preliminary data on inositol was negative, while one RCT for vitamin D demonstrated positive results. For vitamin B12 one and for SAMe two RCTs and a few open trials are available reporting positive and mixed results. To summarize, for most of the substances, the available data is not yet sufficient or inconclusive."			2017				4468
The impact of Tai Chi and Qigong mind-body exercises on motor and non-motor function and quality of life in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Song, R., Grabowska, W., Park, M., Osypiuk, K., Vergara-Diaz, G. P., Bonato, P., Hausdorff, J. M., Fox, M., Sudarsky, L. R., Macklin, E. and Wayne, P. M.				parkinsonism & related disorders	parkinsonism & related disorders	PURPOSE: To systematically evaluate and quantify the effects of Tai Chi/Qigong (TCQ) on motor (UPDRS III, balance, falls, Timed-Up-and-Go, and 6-Minute Walk) and non-motor (depression and cognition) function, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: A systematic search in 7 electronic databases targeted clinical studies evaluating TCQ for individuals with PD published through August 2016. Meta-analysis was used to estimate effect sizes (Hedges's g) and publication bias for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methodological bias in RCTs was assessed by two raters. RESULTS: Our search identified 21 studies, 15 of which were RCTs with a total of 735 subjects. For RCTs, comparison groups included no treatment (n = 7, 47%) and active interventions (n = 8, 53%). Duration of TCQ ranged from 2 to 6 months. Methodological bias was low in 6 studies, moderate in 7, and high in 2. Fixed-effect models showed that TCQ was associated with significant improvement on most motor outcomes (UPDRS III [ES = -0.444, p < 0.001], balance [ES = 0.544, p < 0.001], Timed-Up-and-Go [ES = -0.341, p = 0.005], 6 MW [ES = -0.293, p = 0.06], falls [ES = -0.403, p = 0.004], as well as depression [ES = -0.457, p = 0.008] and QOL [ES = -0.393, p < 0.001], but not cognition [ES = -0.225, p = 0.477]). I(2) indicated limited heterogeneity. Funnel plots suggested some degree of publication bias. CONCLUSION: Evidence to date supports a potential benefit of TCQ for improving motor function, depression and QOL for individuals with PD, and validates the need for additional large-scale trials.			2017				5126
Efficacy of different methods used for dry socket prevention and risk factor analysis: A systematic review		Taberner-Vallverdú, M., Sánchez-Garcés, MÁ and Gay-Escoda, C.				medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal	medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal	"BACKGROUND: Dry socket is one of the most common complications that develops after the extraction of a permanent tooth, and its prevention is more effective than its treatment. OBJECTIVES: Analyze the efficacy of different methods used in preventing dry socket in order to decrease its incidence after tooth extraction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Cochrane and PubMed-MEDLINE database search was conducted with the search terms ""dry socket"", ""prevention"", ""risk factors"", ""alveolar osteitis"" and ""fibrynolitic alveolitis"", both individually and using the Boolean operator ""AND"". The inclusion criteria were: clinical studies including at least 30 patients, articles published from 2005 to 2015 and written in English. The exclusion criteria were case reports and nonhuman studies. RESULTS: 30 publications were selected from a total of 250. Six of the 30 were excluded after reading the full text. The final review included 24 articles: 9 prospective studies, 2 retrospective studies and 13 clinical trials. They were stratified according to their level of scientific evidence using SIGN criteria (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network). CONCLUSIONS: All treatments included in the review were aimed at decreasing the incidence of dry socket. Locally administering chlorhexidine or applying platelet-rich plasma reduces the likelihood of developing this complication. Antibiotic prescription does not avoid postoperative complications after lower third molar surgery. With regard to risk factors, all of the articles selected suggest that patient age, history of previous infection and the difficulty of the extraction are the most common predisposing factors for developing dry socket. There is no consensus that smoking, gender or menstrual cycles are risk factors. Taking the scientific quality of the articles evaluated into account, a level B recommendation has been given for the proposed-procedures in the prevention of dry socket."			2017				4821
Effect of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: a meta-analysis?		Tian, T., Ye, J. and Zhou, S.				international journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics	international journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics	INTRODUCTION: Pertuzumab, as an adjunctive therapy to trastuzumab and docetaxel, has been reported to be potentially beneficial for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. However, the results remain controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab supplementation in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Medline, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, Cochrane library databases, EMBASE, Springer, and Science Direct were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of pertuzumab + trastuzumab + docetaxel vs. trastuzumab + docetaxel on the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer were included. Two investigators independently searched articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. The primary outcomes were death, overall survival, and progression-free survival. Meta-analysis was performed using fixed- or random-effect model. RESULTS: Five RCTs involving 3,742 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with placebo and trastuzumab + docetaxel treatment, combination treatment of pertuzumab + trastuzumab + docetaxel treatment was associated with the significantly reduced death (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.57 - 0.78; p.			2017				5209
Systematic Literature Review and Meta-analysis of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Experienced Rheumatoid Arthritis		Wells, A. F., Curtis, J. R., Betts, K. A., Douglas, K., Du, E. X. and Ganguli, A.				clinical therapeutics	clinical therapeutics	PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to compile all available evidence regarding the efficacy of tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF) inhibitors, non-TNF biologics, and tofacitinib for TNF-experienced patients who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A systematic literature review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and rheumatology conference abstracts was performed to identify observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting American College of Rheumatology response rates (ACR 20/50/70) for adult patients with RA who switched from at least 1 TNF to another TNF or a non-TNF therapy. A direct random effects meta-analysis was performed to evaluate ACR 20/50/70 response rates for TNF and non-TNF therapies. Separate analyses were conducted among 3-, 6-, and 12-month observational studies and for 6-month RCTs. FINDINGS: A total of 18 observational studies and 6 RCTs were selected. Among 3-month observational studies, the percentages of ACR20/50/70 responders switching to another TNF were similar to those switching to a non-TNF biologic (ACR20, 54.5% vs 58.6%; ACR50, 33.3% vs 33.3%; and ACR70, 13.0% vs 14.6%, respectively). Among 6-month observational studies, the percentages of TNF ACR20/50/70 responders were higher than those of non-TNF responders (ACR20, 67.7% vs 50.4%; ACR50, 50.4% vs 26.6%; and ACR70, 24.9% vs 11.6%). Among 6-month RCTs, the percentages of non-TNF biologic ACR20/50/70 responders were similar to those in the 6-month non-TNF observational studies (ACR20, 50.7% vs 50.4%; ACR50, 27.5% vs 26.6%; and ACR70, 11.9% vs 11.6%). For 12-month observational studies, TNF biologic ACR20/50/70 percentages were higher than those of non-TNF therapies (ACR20, 72.2% vs 57.0%; ACR50, 42.1% vs 28.9%; and ACR70, 22.9% vs 10.0%). IMPLICATIONS: For TNF-experienced patients with RA, subsequent TNF therapy and non-TNF biologic therapy have comparable efficacy.			2017				4524
Systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing palbociclib with chemotherapy agents for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR-positive and HER2-negative advanced/metastatic breast cancer		Wilson, F. R., Varu, A., Mitra, D., Cameron, C. and Iyer, S.				breast cancer research and treatment	breast cancer research and treatment	PURPOSE: To compare palbociclib + letrozole and palbociclib + fulvestrant with chemotherapy agents in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced/metastatic breast cancer (ABC/MBC) who had no prior systemic treatment for advanced disease (first line) or whose disease progressed after prior endocrine therapy or chemotherapy (second line). METHODS: A systematic search identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from January 2000 to January 2016 that compared endocrine-based therapies, chemotherapy agents, and/or chemotherapy agents + biological therapies in the first- and second-line treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC. The main outcome of interest was progression-free survival (PFS)/time to progression (TTP). Bayesian network meta-analyses (NMAs) and pairwise meta-analyses were conducted. Heterogeneity and inconsistency were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty RCTs met eligibility criteria and were stratified by line of therapy. In the first line, palbociclib + letrozole showed statistically significant improvements in PFS/TTP versus capecitabine [intermittent: HR 0.28 (95% CrI 0.11-0.72)] and mitoxantrone [HR 0.28 (0.13-0.61)], and trended toward improvements versus paclitaxel [HR 0.59 (0.19-1.96)], docetaxel [HR 0.51 (0.14-2.03)] and other monotherapy or combination agents (HRs ranging from 0.24 to 0.99). In the second line, palbociclib + fulvestrant showed statistically significant improvements in PFS/TTP versus capecitabine [intermittent: HR 0.28 (0.13-0.65)], mitoxantrone [HR 0.26 (0.12-0.53)], and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [HR 0.19 (0.07-0.50)], and trended toward improvements versus paclitaxel [HR 0.48 (0.16-1.44)], docetaxel [HR 0.71 (0.24-2.13)] and other monotherapy or combination agents (HRs ranging from 0.23-0.89). NMA findings aligned with direct evidence and were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Palbociclib + letrozole and palbociclib + fulvestrant demonstrate trends in incremental efficacy compared with chemotherapy agents for the first- and second-line treatment of HR +/HER2- ABC/MBC.			2017				5079
Comparative beneficiary effects of immunotherapy against chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC: Meta-analysis and systematic review		Yu, D. P., Cheng, X., Liu, Z. D. and Xu, S. F.				oncology letters	oncology letters	Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and it is the third ranked in women. There are two major types of lung cancer, namely, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which accounts for ~20% of the cases, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the most common. Chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy have been used as the first-line therapies but suffer from lack of efficacy and also of several toxic adverse effects. Immunotherapeutic approaches including tumor antigen vaccination, monoclonal antibodies targeting checkpoint pathways and also activated immune cells are being developed and have been shown to be effective in treating NSCLC. Despite their promise, efficacy of several immunotherapies has not been consistent. We undertook this meta-analysis study to analyze results from clinical trials that compared efficacy and safety of immunotherapies with placebo or chemotherapy/radiotherapy in improving overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of NSCLC patients. Various databases were searched to identify randomized clinical studies examining the efficacy and safety of antibody- and vaccine-based immunotherapies in NSCLC patients in comparison to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy or placebo. Effects on OS and PFS and also adverse events have been compared. In accordance with the selection criteria, a total of 13 studies with 3,513 patients in immunotherapy and 3,072 patients in chemotherapy/placebo, were selected. PFS (odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 1.36, 2.42; P<0.0001) and OS (P<0.0001) are found to be greatly improved by immunotherapies. Immunotherapy of NSCLC patients was also found to prevent several adverse effects and to improve daily living ability of the patients. The present meta-analysis strongly suggests that immunotherapy improves OS and PFS of patients with NSCLC.			2017				4824
Comparison of Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis		Zazzeroni, L., Pasquinelli, G., Nanni, E., Cremonini, V. and Rubbi, I.				kidney & blood pressure research	kidney & blood pressure research	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The increase in the survival rate of patients with chronic renal failure due to substitution treatment prompts an investigation of their quality of life (QoL), a key measure to evaluate the outcomes of chronic disease treatment. To determine whether hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis provide a better QoL, a systematic meta-analysis was performed. METHODS: We searched through the database Cinahl, Medline, PubMed, Scopus and Proquest, including articles published from 2011 until June 2016. We selected articles that compared, through KDQOL-SF 1.3 or 36 questionnaires, QoL among patients undergoing hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. The data was collected using Excel Office, and t-test has been performed on independent samples to identify significant differences. RESULTS: Only some of the seven articles found significant differences between the two treatments. One of the studies showed a better QoL for peritoneal dialysis patients, while, on the contrary, two other studies support that the best QoL is in patients receiving hemodialysis. Another article displayed significant difference only for satisfaction in relation to care, better in patients on peritoneal dialysis, and for physical health, better in hemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis has not led to a unanimous conclusion. Quantitative analysis showed that the only statistically significant difference between the QoL of patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis regards the effect of kidney disease, which happens to be better in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.			2017				4971
Thymectomy is a beneficial therapy for patients with non-thymomatous ocular myasthenia gravis: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Zhu, K., Li, J., Huang, X., Xu, W., Liu, W., Chen, J., Chen, P. and Feng, H.				neurological sciences : official journal of the italian neurological society and of the italian society of clinical neurophysiology	neurological sciences : official journal of the italian neurological society and of the italian society of clinical neurophysiology	Ocular myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease, is characterized by extraocular muscle weakness. Myasthenia gravis is closely associated with the functional status of the thymus gland. The efficacy of thymectomy for non-thymomatous ocular myasthenia gravis remains controversial. Here, we present the first systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing the outcome of thymectomy in patients with non-thymomatous ocular myasthenia gravis and found that the pooled rate of complete stable remission was 0.5074 with considerable heterogeneity. Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed that the efficacy of thymectomy differed according to geographical location. Furthermore, thymectomy outcomes are better in children than they are in adults. Thymectomy clearly represents an effective treatment for patients with non-thymomatous ocular myasthenia gravis. However, more multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials are now required to confirm these conclusions.			2017				4560
