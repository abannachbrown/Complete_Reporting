Laser therapy may be better than topical desensitizing agents for treating dentin hypersensitivity		Blatz, M. B.				the journal of evidence-based dental practice	the journal of evidence-based dental practice	SELECTION CRITERIA: Two independent reviewers screened the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of ControlledTrials, the National Research Register, and the Cochrane Oral HealthGroup'sTrials Register for articles written in English between 1977 and January1, 2010. The inclusion criteria comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving the application of laser desensitizing procedures and topical desensitizing agents in patients with at least 2 or more hypersensitive teeth confirmed by evaporative stimulus or tactile hypersensitivity assessment. Trial groups needed to receive laser therapy, whereas the control groups received topical desensitizing agents, such as fluoride varnish, dentin bonding agents, or others. Outcomes had to be measured by clinical performance (decrease of hypersensitivity) and/or patients' self-assessment. Studies with loss in follow-up greater than 20% or with confusing data/probable errors were excluded. A total of 176 potential relevant titles, abstracts, and articles were found, 28 of which were screened for further evaluation. Out of these, 8 trials met all inclusion criteria, involving a total of 234 patients. The quality of these trials was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Accordingly, only 1 study was classified as A level, 5 as B level, and 2 as C level. A meta-analysis was not performed because of the heterogeneity of the studies. KEY STUDY FACTOR: Studies that assess the application of laser desensitizing procedures in reducing dentinal hypersensitivity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was reduction of tooth sensitivity following treatment with either a laser or a topical desensitizing agent. Evaluations were made at varying intervals up to 6 months after treatment. MAIN RESULTS: Eight trials reporting on a total of 234 patients were included based on the specified criteria and 20 articles were excluded. Sample size in each of the included studies varied from 20 to 70 patients with differing follow-up intervals of up to 6 months. Most studies used Visual Analog Scale scores or other subjective tools to assess sensitivity. All 8 studies compared one kind of laser versus one kind of topical desensitizingagent. However, types of lasers as well as types of desensitizing agents differed among the reviewed studies. Half of the studies compared gallium-aluminum-arsenide (GaAlAs) lasers with various topical desensitizing agents; however, findings were conflicting. Two moderate-quality trials indicated that GaAlAs laser and the control desensitizing agents preformed similarly. Another moderate-quality trial demonstrated that the application of a bonding agent was significantly better than a GaAlAs laser in the reduction of hypersensitivity. The only reviewed study that was classified as an A-level study revealed a significantly greater immediate and long-term desensitizing effect than the control. The remaining studies involved Nd:YAG, Er:YAG, and CO(2) lasers, all of them reporting a slightly greater decrease in sensitivity as compared with topical desensitizing agents. Five of 8s tudies reported on the safety of laser application and did not find any detrimental pulpal effects, allergic reactions, or clinically detectable complications during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that the results obtained from the 8 studies included in this systematic review were conflicting but indicated a slight clinical advantage of laser therapy over topical medicaments in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity. It was further concluded that application of lasers under controlled parameters for this indication may not lead to adverse effects.			2012				2541
Comparative effectiveness and safety of biological treatment options after tumour necrosis factor ? inhibitor failure in rheumatoid arthritis: systematic review and indirect pairwise meta-analysis		Schoels, M., Aletaha, D., Smolen, J. S. and Wong, J. B.				annals of the rheumatic diseases	annals of the rheumatic diseases	BACKGROUND: Optimal treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after inadequate response (IR) to tumour necrosis factor ? inhibitors (TNFi) remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of biological agents after TNFi-IR. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out using Medline and Cochrane databases, as well as http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, and bibliographies of the retrieved literature were searched by hand. Randomised, placebo-controlled trials that enrolled patients with RA with TNFi-IR were included and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response as primary efficacy outcome and adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and serious infections (SIs) as safety measures were extracted. An indirect meta-analysis with pairwise comparisons of efficacy and safety data was then carried out using ORs or risk differences (RDs) in a random effects model. RESULTS: In four randomised controlled trials with 24 weeks' follow-up, direct comparisons of abatacept, golimumab, rituximab and tocilizumab versus placebo showed statistically significant mean ORs of 3.3-8.9 for ACR20, 5.5-10.2 for ACR50 and 4.1-13.5 for ACR70. Risks of AEs, SAEs and SIs versus placebo were non-significant. Indirect pairwise comparisons of the four biological agents showed no significant differences in ACR50 and ACR70. Golimumab had a significantly lower OR (0.56-0.59) for ACR20 but significantly fewer AEs (RD 0.13-0.18). Efficacy after one versus multiple TNFi failures did not differ significantly between the different biological agents. CONCLUSION: In patients refractory to one or more TNFi, new biological agents provide significant improvement with good safety. Lacking head-to-head trials, indirect meta-analysis enables a comparison of effectiveness and safety of biological agents with each other and shows that all biological agents have similar effects.			2012				2047
Systematic review of the literature on vitamin A and memory		Fragoso, Yara Dadalti, Campos, Niklas Söderberg, Tenrreiro, Breno Faria and Guillen, Fernanda Jussio				dementia & neuropsychologia	dementia & neuropsychologia	BACKGROUND: Over the last 30 years, a variety of studies reporting the effects of vitamin A on memory have been published. OBJECTIVE: To perform a rigorous systematic review of the literature on vitamin A and memory in order to organize evidence-based data on the subject. METHODS: Four authors carried out the systematic review in accordance with strict guidelines. The terms 'vitamin A' OR 'retinol' OR 'retinoic acid' AND 'memory' OR 'cognition' OR 'Alzheimer' were searched in virtually all medical research databases. RESULTS: From 236 studies containing the key words, 44 were selected for this review, numbering 10 reviews and 34 original articles. Most studies used animal models for studying vitamin A and cognition. Birds, mice and rats were more frequently employed whereas human studies accounted for only two reports on brain tissue from autopsies and one on the role of isotretinoin in cognition among individuals taking this medication to treat acne. CONCLUSION: Vitamin A may be an important and viable complement in the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer’s disease. Clinical trials are imperative and, at present, there is no evidence-based data to recommend vitamin A supplementation for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

[Art therapy in psychosocial rehabilitation of patients with mental disorders]		Apotsos, P.				psychiatrik? = psychiatriki	psychiatrik? = psychiatriki	"Despite the use of art therapy in various psychiatric structures and articles supporting its application, in recent years very few data grounded on primary research have been published. Given the complexity of psychiatric disorders the number of people who suffer from them, and the fact that the primary treatment in psychiatric disorders remains pharmacotherapy, questions about the effectiveness of art therapy (as a complimentary treatment) remain open. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of art therapy in psychosocial rehabilitation of people with psychiatric disorders. A search of the literature and electronic databases using indexing words was conducted. The criteria for inclusion of articles were: a. studies had to be ""outcome-intervention"" studies, b. studies should concern only intervention in adults, and c. studies had to include patients with diagnoses according to the DSM of the American Psychiatric Association. Finally, only five articles were included in this systematic review. There is evidence for the effectiveness of art therapy in areas related to the psychosocial rehabilitation of persons suffering from psychiatric disorders, usually in combination with pharmacotherapy. The findings of the surveys reviewed are encouraging and justify the conduct of additional primary research."			2012				2367
Is exercise training beneficial for heart failure patients taking ?-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review and meta-analysis		Ismail, H., McFarlane, J. and Smart, N. A.				congestive heart failure (greenwich, conn.)	congestive heart failure (greenwich, conn.)	The authors sought to conduct a systematic review comparing the effects of exercise training in heart failure patients taking ?-blockers vs those not. A systematic search of exercise training trials in chronic heart failure patients that compared groups who took ?-blocker medication or compared selective and nonselective ?-blockers during exercise training was conducted. Eight prospective studies met the criteria for the quantitative synthesis, which included data from 236 participants. The increment in peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)) was greater in exercising vs control participants, with a mean difference (MD) of 1.27 mL/kg/min (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.70; P<.00001). In exercising patients, the increment in peak VO(2) was greater in the group taking ?-blocker vs those taking placebo (MD, 1.66 mL/kg/min; 95% CI, 0.36-2.97; P=.01). In exercising patients, there was no difference in the increment of peak VO(2) between nonselective ?-blocker and selective ?-blockers groups (MD, -0.09 mL/kg/min; 95% CI, -1.54-1.36; P=.09). Minnesota Quality of Life Score was significantly better in the exercise group vs sedentary control group (both groups taking ?-blockers) (MD, -11.3; 95% CI, -15.9 to -6.8; P<.00001). Our analysis demonstrated that ?-adrenergic blocker therapy did not reduce exercise capacity or exercise training adaptations and quality of life in heart failure patients.			2013				2784
Which procedure is better for lumbar interbody fusion: anterior lumbar interbody fusion or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion?		Jiang, S. D., Chen, J. W. and Jiang, L. S.				archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery	archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery	INTRODUCTION: Both anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) surgeries are performed to obtain a solid fusion to treat lumbar spondylosis. This systematic review investigated whether surgical complications, nonfusion rate, radiographic outcome, and clinical outcome of ALIF were significantly different from those of TLIF. METHOD: A computerized search of the electronic databases MEDLINE was conducted. Only therapeutic studies with a prospective or retrospective comparative design were considered for inclusion in the present investigation. Two reviewers independently extracted relevant data from each included study. Statistical comparisons were made when appropriate. RESULTS: Nine studies were determined to be appropriate for the systematic review, and all studies were retrospective comparative studies. Blood loss and operative time in ALIF was greater than in TLIF. There was no significant difference in the complication rate between ALIF and TLIF. The restoration of disc height, segmental lordosis, and whole lumbar lordosis in ALIF was superior to TLIF. However, clinical outcomes in ALIF were similar with TLIF, and there was no significant difference in nonfusion rate between the two techniques. Costs of ALIF were greater than those of TLIF. CONCLUSION: Clinical outcomes and nonfusion rate in ALIF were similar to TLIF. However, the restoration of disc height, segmental lordosis, and whole lumbar lordosis in ALIF were superior to those in TLIF, while blood loss, operative time, and costs in ALIF were greater than in TLIF.			2012				2126
Gait disorder rehabilitation using vision and non-vision based sensors: a systematic review		Ali, A., Sundaraj, K., Ahmad, B., Ahamed, N. and Islam, A.				bosnian journal of basic medical sciences / udruženje basi?nih mediciniskih znanosti = association of basic medical sciences	bosnian journal of basic medical sciences / udruženje basi?nih mediciniskih znanosti = association of basic medical sciences	"Even though the amount of rehabilitation guidelines has never been greater, uncertainty continues to arise regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of the rehabilitation of gait disorders. This question has been hindered by the lack of information on accurate measurements of gait disorders. Thus, this article reviews the rehabilitation systems for gait disorder using vision and non-vision sensor technologies, as well as the combination of these. All papers published in the English language between 1990 and June, 2012 that had the phrases ""gait disorder"", ""rehabilitation"", ""vision sensor"", or ""non vision sensor"" in the title, abstract, or keywords were identified from the SpringerLink, ELSEVIER, PubMed, and IEEE databases. Some synonyms of these phrases and the logical words ""and"", ""or"", and ""not"" were also used in the article searching procedure. Out of the 91 published articles found, this review identified 84 articles that described the rehabilitation of gait disorders using different types of sensor technologies. This literature set presented strong evidence for the development of rehabilitation systems using a markerless vision-based sensor technology. We therefore believe that the information contained in this review paper will assist the progress of the development of rehabilitation systems for human gait disorders."			2012				1783
Bed occupancy rates and hospital-acquired infections--should beds be kept empty?		Kaier, K., Mutters, N. T. and Frank, U.				clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the european society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases	clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the european society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases	There is growing evidence that bed occupancy (BO) rates, overcrowding and understaffing influence the spread of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). In this article, a systematic review of the literature is presented, summarizing the evidence on the adverse effects of high BO rates and overcrowding in hospitals on the incidence of HAIs. A Pubmed database search identified 179 references, of which 44 were considered to be potentially relevant for full-text review. The majority (62.9%) focused on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated infection or colonization. Only 12 studies were found that provided a statistical analysis of the impact of BO on HAI rates. The median BO rate of the analysed studies was 81.2%. The majority of studies (75%) indicated that BO rates and understaffing directly influence the incidence of HAIs. Only three studies showed no significant association between BO rates and the incidence of HAIs. Interestingly, only one of the included studies detected a seasonal trend in the BO rate. The present review shows an association between BO rates and the spread of HAIs in various settings. Because the evidence on this topic is limited, we conclude that further research is needed in order to analyse the rationale of a threshold BO rate, because keeping beds empty is comparatively costly.			2012				2141
Association between omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and risk of major cardiovascular disease events: a systematic review and meta-analysis		Rizos, E. C., Ntzani, E. E., Bika, E., Kostapanos, M. S. and Elisaf, M. S.				jama : the journal of the american medical association	jama : the journal of the american medical association	CONTEXT: Considerable controversy exists regarding the association of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and major cardiovascular end points. OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of omega-3 supplementation on major cardiovascular outcomes. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through August 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of omega-3 on all-cause mortality, cardiac death, sudden death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. DATA EXTRACTION: Descriptive and quantitative information was extracted; absolute and relative risk (RR) estimates were synthesized under a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic and I2. Subgroup analyses were performed for the presence of blinding, the prevention settings, and patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and meta-regression analyses were performed for the omega-3 dose. A statistical significance threshold of .0063 was assumed after adjustment for multiple comparisons. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 3635 citations retrieved, 20 studies of 68,680 patients were included, reporting 7044 deaths, 3993 cardiac deaths, 1150 sudden deaths, 1837 myocardial infarctions, and 1490 strokes. No statistically significant association was observed with all-cause mortality (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.02; risk reduction [RD] -0.004, 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.02), cardiac death (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.98; RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.00), sudden death (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01; RD, -0.003; 95% CI, -0.012 to 0.006), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.04; RD, -0.002; 95% CI, -0.007 to 0.002), and stroke (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.18; RD, 0.001; 95% CI, -0.002 to 0.004) when all supplement studies were considered. CONCLUSION: Overall, omega-3 PUFA supplementation was not associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, sudden death, myocardial infarction, or stroke based on relative and absolute measures of association.			2012				2008
Palliative excisional surgery for primary colorectal cancer in patients with incurable metastatic disease. Is there a survival benefit? A systematic review		Anwar, S., Peter, M. B., Dent, J. and Scott, N. A.				colorectal disease : the official journal of the association of coloproctology of great britain and ireland	colorectal disease : the official journal of the association of coloproctology of great britain and ireland	AIM: Patients with stage IV colorectal cancer with unresectable metastases can either receive chemotherapy or palliative resection of the primary lesion. In the absence of any randomized data the choice of initial treatment in stage IV colorectal cancer is not based on firm evidence. METHOD: A search of MEDLINE, Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane Library database was performed from 1980 to 2010 for studies comparing palliative resection in stage IV colorectal cancer with other treatment modalities. Audits and observational studies were excluded. Median survival was the primary outcome measure. The morbidity and mortality of surgical and nonsurgical treatments were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (no randomized controlled trials) were identified. Most demonstrated a survival benefit for patients who underwent palliative resection. Multivariate analysis indicates that tumour burden and performance status are both major independent prognostic variables. Selection bias, incomplete follow up and nonstandardized reporting of complications make the data difficult to interpret. CONCLUSION: The studies indicate that there may be a survival benefit for primary resection of colorectal cancer in stage IV disease. The findings suggest that resection of the primary tumour should be based on tumour burden and performance status rather than on the presence or absence of symptoms alone.			2012				2038
Sodium bicarbonate therapy for the prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury – a systematic review and meta-analysis –		Jang, J. S., Jin, H. Y., Seo, J. S., Yang, T. H., Kim, D. K., Kim, T. H., Urm, S. H., Kim, D. S., Kim, D. K., Seol, S. H., Kim, D. I., Cho, K. I., Kim, B. H., Park, Y. H., Je, H. G., Ahn, J. M., Kim, W. J., Lee, J. Y. and Lee, S. W.				circulation journal : official journal of the japanese circulation society	circulation journal : official journal of the japanese circulation society	BACKGROUND: Sodium bicarbonate has been postulated to prevent contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) by various mechanisms, although the reports are conflicting. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials that compared a sodium chloride with a sodium bicarbonate hydration regimen with regard to CI-AKI. Data across 19 clinical trials consisting of 3,609 patients were combined. Preprocedural hydration with sodium bicarbonate was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of CI-AKI (odds ratio [OR] 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36-0.86; P=0.008). Stratified analyses by the type of contrast medium suggested lower odds of CI-AKI with sodium bicarbonate in studies using low-osmolar contrast media (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.23-0.71, P=0.002) compared with those using the iso-osmolar agents (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.41-1.43; P=0.40). No significant difference in the rates of postprocedural death (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.23-1.04; P=0.06) and the requirement for renal replacement therapy (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.46-1.91; P=0.86) was observed. However, we found significant changes in serum bicarbonate and potassium levels after sodium bicarbonate infusion. CONCLUSIONS: This updated meta-analysis demonstrates that sodium bicarbonate-based hydration is superior to sodium chloride in preventing CI-AKI of patients undergoing exposure to iodinated contrast media.			2012				1952
Management of cardiovascular disease risk factors in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury: an evidence-based review		Cragg, J. J., Stone, J. A. and Krassioukov, A. V.				journal of neurotrauma	journal of neurotrauma	Clinical scenario: A 37-year-old man suffered a complete spinal cord injury (C8, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [ASIA] score A) 10 years ago in a car accident. Should primary prevention of cardiovascular disease be a priority in this patient? In order to answer this question, we performed a systematic review of the literature to inform an evidence-based clinical review. The objective was to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the clinical management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Comprehensive literature searches were performed. The quality of each study was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale for randomized controlled trials, and the Downs and Black Scale for all other studies. Levels of evidence were assigned using a modified version of Sackett's scale. Our findings indicate that CVD is a critical issue in individuals with chronic SCI. Almost all risk factors for CVD are amplified in individuals with SCI, including physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, blood pressure irregularities, abnormal glycemic control, and chronic inflammation. However, there is a paucity of high-quality literature with respect to treatment outcomes in SCI-specific study populations (a total of 22 intervention studies in all of these categories combined) that allow for the development of evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations. These limitations notwithstanding, we present a series of contemporary practice suggestions with regard to CVD event risk modification in SCI patients. For optimal outcomes, health care providers should be cognizant of these heightened CVD risk factors and the resultant increased CVD morbidity and mortality in SCI patients. Despite the absence of high-quality evidence-based treatment strategies, clinicians should re-examine their own CVD risk factor treatment strategies to better reflect contemporary practice in similar high-CVD-event-risk patients and populations.			2012				2264
A systematic review of transapical aortic valve implantation		Rahnavardi, M., Santibanez, J., Sian, K. and Yan, T. D.				annals of cardiothoracic surgery	annals of cardiothoracic surgery	BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) through a transapical approach (TAAVI) for severe aortic stenosis becomes the procedure of choice in cases where patients have peripheral artery disease and unfeasible access due to excessive atherosclerotic disease of the iliofemoral vessels and aorta. The present systematic review aimed to assess the safety, success rate, clinical outcomes, hemodynamic outcomes, and survival benefits of TAAVI. METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in 6 databases from January 2000 to February 2012. The primary end points included feasibility and safety. Other end points included echocardiographic findings, functional class improvement, and survival. RESULTS: After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 48 out of 154 shortlisted potentially relevant articles were selected for assessment. Of these, 26 studies from 24 centers including total number of 2,807 patients were included for appraisal and data extraction. The current evidence on TAAVI for aortic stenosis is limited to observational studies. Successful TAAVI implantation occurred in >90% of patients. On average, the procedure took between 64 to 154 minutes to complete. The incidence of major adverse events included 30-day mortality (4.7-20.8%); cerebrovascular accident (0-16.3%); major tachyarrhythmia (0-48.8%); bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacemaker insertion (0-18.7%); cardiac tamponade (0-11%); major bleeding (1-17%); myocardial infarction (0-6%); aortic dissection/rupture (0-5%); moderate to severe paravalvular leak (0.7-24%); cardiopulmonary bypass support (0-15%); conversion to surgery (0-9.5%); and valve-in-valve implantation (0.6-8%). Mean aortic valve area improved from 0.4-0.7 cm(2) before TAAVI to 1.4-2.1 cm(2) after TAAVI. The peak pressure gradient across the aortic valve decreased from >70 mmHg to <20 mmHg after TAAVI. One-year survival ranged from 49.3% to 82% and the 3-year survival was 58% in 2 series. CONCLUSIONS: TAAVI appears to be feasible with a reasonable safety and efficacy portfolio. Randomised controlled trials are required to compare transapical vs. transfemoral TAVI when both techniques are equally feasible.			2012				1027
Combination therapy an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker for IgA nephropathy: a meta-analysis		Cheng, J., Zhang, X., Tian, J., Li, Q. and Chen, J.				international journal of clinical practice	international journal of clinical practice	Objective: The pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is still unknown. Combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) plus angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) might provide more benefits to IgAN patients. We conducted a systematic review to assess the efficacy of combination therapy for IgAN. Methods: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and article reference lists were searched for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) which involved combination therapy ACEI plus ARB in only one arm. A meta-analysis was performed on the outcomes of proteinuria and renal function in IgAN patients. Results: Six RCTs involving 109 patients were included in the review. Combined treatment with ACEI plus ARB was more effective than with ACEI/ARB alone for reducing daily proteinuria. This did not translate into an improvement in GFR. Patients receiving ACEI plus ARB therapy did not have an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Conclusions: The current cumulative evidence suggests that combination therapy ACEI plus ARB may provide more benefits to IgAN patients for reducing daily proteinuria. Long-term effects of these agents on renal outcomes, and safety need to be established.			2012				2248
Meta-analysis of re-operation, nonunion, and infection after open reduction and internal fixation of patella fractures		Dy, C. J., Little, M. T., Berkes, M. B., Ma, Y., Roberts, T. R., Helfet, D. L. and Lorich, D. G.				the journal of trauma and acute care surgery	the journal of trauma and acute care surgery	BACKGROUND: The subcutaneous location of the patella and the demand for early knee motion contribute to the difficulty in treating patients with patella fractures. The reported rates in the literature for hardware removal after patella open reduction and internal fixation range from 0% to 60%. The wide variability of these reports leaves the true frequency of re-operation and complications after patella open reduction and internal fixation in question. Furthermore, gaining a better understanding of the factors that contribute to re-operation and complications will help to generate hypotheses and research agendas to address these difficult problems. METHODS: We performed a systematic review to identify publications in which adult patients with patella fractures were surgically treated with a minimum of 6-month follow-up. The surgical technique (tension band or other), infection rate, nonunion rate, and re-operation rate (including removal of hardware) were recorded. Meta-regression analysis was used to describe the potential contributory factors for re-operation, nonunion, and infection while controlling for age, gender, open fracture, surgical technique, and date of publication. Separate regression models were constructed for each outcome depending on the number of studies available for inclusion. RESULTS: The frequency of re-operation was 33.6% in a meta-analysis of 24 studies (737 patella fractures). The frequency of infection was 3.2% in a meta-analysis of 18 studies (522 patella fractures). The frequency of nonunion was 1.3% in a meta-analysis of 15 studies (464 patella fractures). There were no significant predictors for re-operation, nonunion, or infection in any of the regression analyses. CONCLUSION: Although the frequencies of nonunion and infection are relatively low after surgical treatment of patella fractures, the modern rate of re-operation is substantial.

Prevention of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy in STEMI Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A Systematic Review		Busch, S. V., Jensen, S. E., Rosenberg, J. and Gögenur, I.				journal of interventional cardiology	journal of interventional cardiology	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current prophylactic strategies against CIN in patients with STEMI treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention. BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is the third leading course of acute renal failure and a recognized complication to cardiac catheterization. CIN is associated with increased risk of cardiac adverse events and mortality, and recent studies point at the risk of developing a transient or persistent renal dysfunction. Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention have a markedly increased risk of developing CIN. At present no strategy is universally accepted in the prevention of CIN in the acute setting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention. METHOD: We performed a systematic search in Pubmed and EMBASE and ended up including nine randomised clinical trials; six studies of N-acetylcysteine, one study of early and late hydration regimens, one study of recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide and one study comparing a low-osmolar contrast agent with an iso-osmolar contrast agent. RESULTS: Recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide and the regimens of hydration significantly reduced the incidence of CIN and administration of N-acetylcysteine in one of the six studies significantly reduced the occurrence of CIN. The iso-osmolar contrast agent was not proven to be superior to the low-osmolar contrast agent in terms of preventing CIN. CONCLUSION: Preliminary studies are promising but further studies are needed before any prevention strategy against CIN can be recommended in routine care of patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI.			2013				3427
Flow-diverting stents for the treatment of arterial aneurysms		Sfyroeras, G. S., Dalainas, I., Giannakopoulos, T. G., Antonopoulos, K., Kakisis, J. D. and Liapis, C. D.				journal of vascular surgery	journal of vascular surgery	BACKGROUND: Anatomic factors may limit the application of stent grafts for the treatment of arterial aneurysms. Flow- diverting stents (FDSs) are specially designed to reduce flow velocity in the aneurysm sac and promote thrombosis while maintaining flow in the main artery and branch vessels. FDSs include the Pipeline Embolization Device (ev3, Plymouth, Minn), the SILK Arterial Reconstruction Device (Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France), and the Cardiatis Multilayer Stent (Cardiatis, Isnes, Belgium). The first two have been mainly used for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The aim of this study was to review the current role of FDSs in the treatment of extracranial arterial aneurysms. METHODS: A systematic electronic health database search was conducted using PubMed, Ovid, Medline, and the Cochrane Database on all accessible published articles through March 2012. An additional search for abstracts presented in international congresses for vascular surgery was also performed. Full-text articles and abstracts were analyzed separately due to the heterogeneity of the data. RESULTS: Results of the use of FDSs in arterial aneurysms were reported in 12 full-text articles including 35 patients (26 men, age 65.4) with 38 aneurysms. The aneurysms were located in the hepatic (n = 12), splenic (n = 6), renal (n = 5), celiac (n = 4), superior mesenteric (n = 3), subclavian (n = 2), gastroduodenal (n = 1), and popliteal arteries (n = 1) and in the descending thoracic (n = 1), suprarenal (n = 1) and infrarenal aorta (n = 2). The 30-day mortality was 5.7% (2 of 35 patients). Three stent thromboses occurred (8.3%), none of them with clinical consequences. Thirty patients with 33 aneurysms and patent FDSs were monitored for an average of 9.2 months. Thrombosis occurred in 90.6%, and volume reduction was observed in 81% of the aneurysms. No branch vessel occlusion occurred. Twelve abstracts were identified, including 133 patients (mean age, 64.7 years). They included 62 peripheral, 28 visceral, and 43 abdominal and thoracoabdominal aneurysms. The Cardiatis Multilayer Stent was used in all cases. Thrombosis was achieved in all but two peripheral and visceral aneurysms. Volume reduction was observed in 82.7%, and no branch vessel occlusion occurred. In aortic aneurysms, better results regarding aneurysm thrombosis, reduction of the volume, and patency of collateral branches were reported at 12 months rather than at 6 months postoperatively. No aneurysm rupture has yet been described. CONCLUSIONS: Initial clinical experience with the use of FDSs in the treatment of visceral and peripheral aneurysms yielded satisfactory results in technical success, aneurysm thrombosis and shrinkage, and in patency of branch vessels. The results in aortic aneurysms are still under investigation. No aneurysm rupture has yet been described. There is a significant incidence of FDS thrombosis. Volume reduction of the aneurysm is a clearer evidence of the clinical success after treatment with FDSs than aneurysm thrombosis.			2012				2603
Efficacy and safety of deep brain stimulation in patients with medication-induced tardive dyskinesia and/or dystonia: a systematic review		Mentzel, C. L., Tenback, D. E., Tijssen, M. A., Visser-Vandewalle, V. E. and van Harten, P. N.				the journal of clinical psychiatry	the journal of clinical psychiatry	BACKGROUND: Tardive dyskinesia and dystonia (TDD) are severe side effects of dopamine-blocking agents, particularly antipsychotics. While deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven effective in the treatment of TDD, little is known about the possible psychiatric complications of DBS in psychiatric patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety, specifically the psychiatric side effects, of DBS in patients with medication-induced TDD. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched systematically on May 25, 2011, for articles written in English, using the search terms deep brain stimulation AND tardive. STUDY SELECTION: Of the 88 original articles retrieved, 17 studies involving 50 patients with TDD who underwent DBS were included in the review. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on the severity of the movement disorders before and after DBS, as rated on the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale or similar scales, were extracted. Data on psychiatric symptoms before and after DBS were used to calculate the percent improvement per patient per rating scale. Overall improvement and confidence intervals were calculated using a 1-sample, 2-sided Student t test. RESULTS: The mean improvement of TDD of the combined patients 3 to 76 months after implantation was 77.5% (95% CI, 71.4%-83.3%; P < .000) on the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale. Of the 50 patients, 1 experienced an exacerbation of depression, and 1 experienced an exacerbation of psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: DBS seems to be effective and relatively safe for patients with treatment-resistant TDD; however, the results should be interpreted with caution, as most of the data are from case reports and small trials.			2012				1970
[Therapy of triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions]		Schädel-Höpfner, M., Müller, K., Gehrmann, S., Lögters, T. T. and Windolf, J.				der unfallchirurg	der unfallchirurg	The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) represents an important anatomical structure interposed between the ulnar carpus and the distal ulnar. Injuries and degenerative changes of the TFCC are of high clinical relevance and there are numerous treatment options available based on different concepts and which are being used to varying extents. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of different therapies for lesions of the TFCC. Studies on TFCC lesions were systematically reviewed, classified into evidence levels and selected according to predefined criteria. A total of 259 publications were identified as being potentially relevant and finally 35 studies could be included in the review. In addition, a survey was performed among German hand surgeons in order to identify commonly used procedures for TFCC lesions in Germany. The classification of Palmer is mostly used both in the literature and in Germany and therapeutic decisions are predominantly based on this classification. The systematic review revealed some common treatment strategies for traumatic and degenerative lesions. Generally, the level of evidence was poor for all identified publications. For this reason, evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of TFCC lesions could not be derived from the literature. There was broad consent between the results of the literature review and the survey.			2012				2078
Financial incentives for smoking cessation among pregnant and newly postpartum women		Higgins, S. T., Washio, Y., Heil, S. H., Solomon, L. J., Gaalema, D. E., Higgins, T. M. and Bernstein, I. M.				preventive medicine	preventive medicine	OBJECTIVE: Smoking during pregnancy is the leading preventable cause of poor pregnancy outcomes in the U.S., causing serious immediate and longer-term adverse effects for mothers and offspring. In this report we provide a narrative review of research on the use of financial incentives to promote abstinence from cigarette smoking during pregnancy, an intervention wherein women earn vouchers exchangeable for retail items contingent on biochemically-verified abstinence from recent smoking. METHODS: Published reports based on controlled trials are reviewed. All of the reviewed research was conducted by one of two research groups who have investigated this treatment approach. RESULTS: Results from six controlled trials with economically disadvantaged pregnant smokers support the efficacy of financial incentives for increasing smoking abstinence rates antepartum and early postpartum. Results from three trials provide evidence that the intervention improves sonographically estimated fetal growth, mean birth weight, percent of low-birth-weight deliveries, and breastfeeding duration. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic use of financial incentives has promise as an efficacious intervention for promoting smoking cessation among economically disadvantaged pregnant and recently postpartum women and improving birth outcomes. Additional trials in larger and more diverse samples are warranted to further evaluate the merits of this treatment approach.			2012				2365
A systematic review of single-bundle versus double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction		Longo, U. G., Buchmann, S., Franceschetti, E., Maffulli, N. and Denaro, V.				british medical bulletin	british medical bulletin	INTRODUCTION: Double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is becoming increasingly common. However, no definitive data on the superiority of DB reconstruction have been shown when compared with single-bundle (SB) ACL reconstruction. SOURCES OF DATA: We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL and Embase databases using various combinations of keywords such as 'ACL', 'reconstruction', 'DB' and 'SB'. Only articles published in peer-reviewed journals were included in this systematic review. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Several new techniques are available for ACL reconstruction. DB ACL reconstruction could provide better outcome for patients in terms of closer restoration of normal knee biomechanics and improving the rotatory laxity of the knee. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Data are lacking to allow definitive conclusions on the use of DB reconstruction techniques for routine management of patients with ACL tear. GROWING POINTS: Given the limitations of the current studies, it is not possible to recommend systematic use of DB ACL reconstruction. Even though biomechanical results are encouraging, subjective patient evaluation is similar for SB and DB reconstruction. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Studies of higher levels of evidence, for instances large adequately powered randomized trials, should be conducted to bring new insight in this field. With the current evidence available, a simple SB ACL reconstruction is a suitable technique, and it should be not abandoned until stronger scientific evidence in favour of DB ACL reconstruction will be produced.			2012				1139
A systematic review of the effect of low-level laser therapy in the management of breast cancer-related lymphedema		Omar, M. T., Shaheen, A. A. and Zafar, H.				supportive care in cancer : official journal of the multinational association of supportive care in cancer	supportive care in cancer : official journal of the multinational association of supportive care in cancer	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to review the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in the management of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). METHODS: A systematic review of seven databases for clinical trials for LLLT in the management of BCRL published between 1990 and 2011 was performed. RESULTS: A total of eight studies on 230 patients were found. The methodological qualities of the selected studies were assessed with the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale, and the studies were categorized according to Sackett's levels of evidence. Five studies were graded at evidence level II. Two studies were graded at evidence level III, and the remaining study was graded at evidence level V. CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate to strong evidence for the effectiveness of LLLT for the management of BCRL from five small studies of acceptable methodological quality. A dose of 1-2 J/cm(2) per point applied to several points covering the fibrotic area can reduce limb volume following BCRL. Further well-designed, large-scale studies are required to determine more precisely how effective LLLT may be in BCRL.			2012				1448
Intratympanic steroid treatment for sudden deafness: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials		Garavello, W., Galluzzi, F., Gaini, R. M. and Zanetti, D.				otology & neurotology : official publication of the american otological society, american neurotology society [and] european academy of otology and neurotology	otology & neurotology : official publication of the american otological society, american neurotology society [and] european academy of otology and neurotology	BACKGROUND: The efficacy of intratympanic steroid (ITS) treatment in sudden deafness (SD) remains controversial. To shed light on this issue, we performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to assess the overall efficacy of ITS therapy and to clarify whether it is more suitable as a first-line approach (primary treatment) or as a salvage treatment when traditional systemic agents have failed. METHODS: An electronic database search (MEDLINE and PubMed) was performed with the objective of identifying all studies published in the English language between January 1980 and November 2011 on the efficacy of ITS in the treatment of SD. All relevant articles were retrieved, and the related reference lists were reviewed systematically to identify other reports that could be included. Data were synthesized using the Mantel-Haenszel model. Results are expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 11 randomized studies including 472 subjects allocated to ITS and 453 controls were selected. Intratympanic steroid regimens used and treatments administered to controls varied widely across studies. When considering together trials investigating ITS therapy as a primary (n = 4) or salvage (n = 7) treatment, the common OR for recovery was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3-2.3). When considering them separately, the common ORs for recovery were 0.9 (95% CI, 0.7-1.6) for primary and 2.9 (95% CI, 1.9-4.5) for salvage therapy. CONCLUSION: Intratympanic steroid therapy seems to confer a certain degree of benefit as a salvage but not as a primary treatment of SD. However, further evidence is needed to clarify some yet uncertain aspects, such as the optimal protocol of therapy.			2012				2514
Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials on probiotics for hepatic encephalopathy		Holte, K., Krag, A. and Gluud, L. L.				hepatology research : the official journal of the japan society of hepatology	hepatology research : the official journal of the japan society of hepatology	AIM: ? The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of probiotics and synbiotics in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. METHODS: ? Eligible trials were identified by searching electronic databases including MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index and Embase, abstract proceedings, reference lists and ongoing trial registers until 13?October 2010. We included randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics and synbiotics with no intervention, placebo or lactulose in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. The primary outcome measure was improvement in hepatic encephalopathy. RESULTS were expressed as risk rates (RR) with confidence intervals (CI) and intertrial heterogeneity as I(2) . RESULTS: ? Seven trials with a total of 393 patients were analyzed. Compared to placebo or lactulose, treatment with probiotics or synbiotics significantly improved hepatic encephalopathy (RR?=?1.40, 95% CI?=?1.05-1.86, I(2) ?=?5%). Probiotics decreased arterial ammonia (weighted mean difference 15.95; 95% CI?=?26.72-3.28; I(2) ?=?68%), but not venous ammonia (weighted mean difference 5.23; 95% CI?=?21.77-11.30; I(2) ?=?89%). Treatment with probiotics or synbiotics did not significantly affect the psychometric tests. Overall adverse events were reported in four trials with no difference between probiotics and placebo groups (RR?=?0.32, 95% CI?=?0.04-2.57; I(2) ?=?59%). Regression analysis showed evidence of small-study effects. CONCLUSION: ? The present meta-analysis suggests that probiotics may be an effective treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, though rigorous evaluation in standardized, randomized, clinical trial with clinically relevant outcomes is still needed.			2012				1271
Fat grafting: evidence-based review on autologous fat harvesting, processing, reinjection, and storage		Gir, P., Brown, S. A., Oni, G., Kashefi, N., Mojallal, A. and Rohrich, R. J.				plastic and reconstructive surgery	plastic and reconstructive surgery	BACKGROUND: Over the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of autologous fat grafting to treat volume and contour defects in aesthetic and reconstructive surgery. It is generally accepted that fat grafting is safe, with good patient satisfaction. However, there are many procedural variations, and in terms of objective clinical effectiveness, the major disadvantage of this technique remains the unpredictable fat resorption rates and subsequent adverse events. Because of the rapidly evolving nature of this procedure, this review article provides an update on previous reviews by looking at the current evidence base regarding fat graft techniques and their effect on clinical outcome. METHODS: A systematic review of the scientific literature listed on PubMed was performed using 20 search terms focused on harvesting, processing, reinjection, and conservation of fat grafting. An evidence-based system was used to determine eligibility for clinical and preclinical studies. RESULTS: Thirty-seven articles were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria: five articles were clinical trials and 32 were experimental comparative studies examining human fat grafting. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review revealed a lack of high-quality data despite the increase in fat grafting over the past 20 years. At present, there is no evidence that supports specific procedural standardization. Evidence-based studies that incorporate randomized controlled, prospective, multicenter trials are required to understand which factors influence positive fat grafting clinical outcomes.			2012				2087
