Low-molecular-weight heparin thromboprophylaxis in medical-surgical critically ill patients: a systematic review		Ribic, C., Lim, W., Cook, D. and Crowther, M.				journal of critical care	journal of critical care	PURPOSE: The study aimed to systematically review the effect of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) thromboprophylaxis in medical-surgical critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. METHODS: In duplicate and independently, we searched for relevant articles using MEDLINE and EMBASE; we also contacted experts and reviewed reference lists. For included studies, we abstracted data on study and patient characteristics, LMWH use, clinical outcomes (venous thromboembolism [VTE], bleeding, and mortality), laboratory outcomes (anti-Xa levels and thrombocytopenia), and methodological quality. RESULTS: We included 8 prospective cohort studies and 1 randomized trial, with a total of 629 patients. Eight studies (n = 406 patients) reported anti-Xa levels and only 3 studies (n = 240 patients) reported on at least one clinical outcome. Low-molecular-weight heparin does not appear to bioaccumulate based on repeated measurements of trough anti-Xa levels. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 9.3% of patients receiving LMWH; heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was not reported. In studies reporting clinical outcomes, the frequency of VTE in patients receiving LMWH ranged from 5.1% to 15.5%, bleeding complications ranged from 7.2% to 23.1%, and mortality ranged from 1.4% to 7.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Low-molecular-weight heparin may be effective for thromboprophylaxis in medical-surgical critically ill patients, but no trials have compared LMWH against an alternative active strategy; thus, LMWH cannot be recommended routinely. Trials testing LMWH thromboprophylaxis are required, which examine patient-important end points such as the incidence and clinical consequences of VTE, bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and mortality.			2009				690
Evidence-based systematic review: Oropharyngeal dysphagia behavioral treatments. Part II -- Impact of dysphagia treatment on normal swallow function		Wheeler-Hegland, K., Ashford, J., Frymark, T., McCabe, D., Mullen, R., Musson, N., Hammond, C., Schooling, T. and Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Gainesville F. L.				journal of rehabilitation research & development	journal of rehabilitation research & development	This article is the second in a series of evidencebased systematic reviews. Data reported cover the impact of dysphagia behavioral interventions on swallow physiology in healthy adults. The behavioral treatments investigated were three postural interventionsDLside lying, chin tuck, and head rotationDLand four swallowing maneuversDLeffortful swallow, the Mendelsohn maneuver, supraglottic swallow, and supersupraglottic swallow. A systematic search of the dysphagia literature was conducted in 14 electronic databases. Seventeen studies meeting the inclusion criteria were evaluated for methodological quality with the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's levels-of-evidence scheme and were characterized by research stage (i.e., exploratory, efficacy, effectiveness, costbenefit/ public policy research). Effect sizes were calculated when possible. All studies were exploratory research ranging from two to five of seven possible quality markers. The majority of studies (8 of 17) investigated effortful swallow. Three studies examined the Mendelsohn maneuver, chin tuck, supraglottic swallow, and super-supraglottic swallow and two studies addressed head rotation. No study addressed side lying. For nondisordered populations, the existing evidence demonstrates differential effects of postural changes and maneuvers on swallowing physiology. Some effects reinforced existing recommendations for the applications of the interventions, while others suggested new ways that the treatments may impact swallow function. Avenues for future research are suggested. Key words: chin-tuck posture, dysphagia, effortful swallow maneuver, evidence-based practice, evidence-based systematic review, head-rotation posture, Mendelsohn maneuver, rehabilitation, side-lying posture, super-supraglottic swallow maneuver, supraglottic swallow maneuver, treatment.			2009				888
Technologically-assisted behaviour change: a systematic review of studies of novel technologies for the management of chronic illness		Rosser, B. A., Vowles, K. E., Keogh, E., Eccleston, C. and Mountain, G. A.				journal of telemedicine and telecare	journal of telemedicine and telecare	A systematic review was conducted to investigate the use of technology in achieving behaviour change in chronic illness. The areas reviewed were: (1) methods employed to adapt traditional therapy from a face-to-face medium to a computer-assisted platform; (2) targets of behaviour change; and (3) level of human (e.g. therapist) involvement. The initial literature search produced 2032 articles. A total of 45 articles reporting 33 separate interventions met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were reviewed in detail. The majority of interventions reported a theoretical basis, with many arising from a cognitive-behavioural framework. There was a wide range of therapy content. Therapist involvement was reported in 73% of the interventions. A common problem was high participant attrition, which may have been related to reduced levels of human interaction. Instigating successful behaviour change through technological interventions poses many difficulties. However, there are potential benefits of delivering therapy in this way. For people with long-term health conditions, technological self-management systems could provide a practical method of understanding and monitoring their condition, as well as therapeutic guidance to alter maladaptive behaviour.			2009				708
Frequency modulation (FM) system in auditory processing disorder: an evidence-based practice?		Lemos, I. C., Jacob, R. T., Gejão, M. G., Bevilacqua, M. C., Feniman, M. R. and Ferrari, D. V.				pró-fono : revista de atualização científica	pró-fono : revista de atualização científica	BACKGROUND: use of frequency modulation (FM) system in auditory processing disorder. AIM: to verify the existence of scientific evidence confirming the effectiveness of personal FM systems in the treatment of central auditory processing disorders (APD). For this purpose a systematic review of the literature was made, using data found in electronic databases (Medline, Lilacs and Cochrane library) as well as on the internet. The articles retrieved were analyzed according to the CONSORT statement and then classified by their evidence level. CONCLUSION: the search resulted in 1,589 references out of which only 19 met the inclusion criteria. All of the analyzed articles were classified as having low level of evidence (expert opinion or case studies). Strong scientific evidence supporting the use of personal FM systems for APD intervention was not found. Since such device is frequently recommended for the treatment of APD, it becomes essential to carry out studies with high scientific evidence that could safely guide clinical decision making on this subject.			2009				455
Quality improvement strategies for children with asthma: a systematic review		Bravata, D. M., Gienger, A. L., Holty, J. E., Sundaram, V., Khazeni, N., Wise, P. H., McDonald, K. M. and Owens, D. K.				archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine	archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence that quality improvement (QI) strategies can improve the processes and outcomes of outpatient pediatric asthma care. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group database (January 1966 to April 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2006), Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group database (January 1966 to May 2006), and bibliographies of retrieved articles. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after trials, or interrupted time series trials of English-language QI evaluations. INTERVENTIONS: Must have included 1 or more QI strategies for the outpatient management of children with asthma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical status (eg, spirometric measures); functional status (eg, days lost from school); and health services use (eg, hospital admissions). RESULTS: Seventy-nine studies met inclusion criteria: 69 included at least some component of patient education, self-monitoring, or self-management; 13 included some component of organizational change; and 7 included provider education. Self-management interventions increased symptom-free days by approximately 10 days/y (P = .02) and reduced school absenteeism by about 0.1 day/mo (P = .03). Interventions of provider education and those that incorporated organizational changes were likely to report improvements in medication use. Quality improvement interventions that provided multiple educational sessions, had longer durations, and used combinations of instructional modalities were more likely to result in improvements for patients than interventions lacking these characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of QI interventions improve the outcomes and processes of care for children with asthma. Use of similar outcome measures and thorough descriptions of interventions would advance the study of QI for pediatric asthma care.			2009				94
Routine use of oxygen in the treatment of myocardial infarction: systematic review		Wijesinghe, M., Perrin, K., Ranchord, A., Simmonds, M., Weatherall, M. and Beasley, R.				heart (british cardiac society)	heart (british cardiac society)	CONTEXT: International guidelines recommend the routine use of oxygen therapy in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). OBJECTIVE: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of oxygen therapy in MI. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and CINHAL. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised placebo-controlled trials of oxygen therapy in MI. DATA EXTRACTION: The primary clinical outcome was mortality. RESULTS: Two of 51 potential studies met the inclusion criteria. The one study with substantive clinical outcome data reported that in uncomplicated MI, high-flow oxygen was associated with a non-significant increased risk of death (risk ratio 2.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 10.3, p = 0.08) and a greater serum aspartate aminotransferase level (difference 19.2 IU/ml, 95% CI 0 to 38.4, p = 0.05) than room air. CONCLUSION: The limited evidence that does exist suggests that the routine use of high-flow oxygen in uncomplicated MI may result in a greater infarct size and possibly increase the risk of mortality.			2009				895
Instruments for the detection of depressive symptoms in people with intellectual disabilities: a systematic review		Perez-Achiaga, N., Nelson, S., Hassiotis, A. and Redbridge Learning Disability Team, U. K. Natalia Perez-Achiaga redbridge gov uk				journal of intellectual disabilities	journal of intellectual disabilities	Affective disorders, particularly depression, are common in adults with intellectual disabilities. However the detection of these disorders is hindered by the varied presentation of depressive symptoms across the range of intellectual disability. We undertook a systematic review of the available English-language diagnostic instruments for depressive disorders for adults with all levels of intellectual disability. We appraised the studies based on the instruments' psychometric properties, sensitivity and specificity. We included 21 of 28 identified studies which contained original data on validity and reliability; the ;gold standard' ranged from clinical opinion to other established instruments, some of which had limited validation in people with intellectual disability. In view of the benefits of psychological treatments for common mental disorders, it is important to develop instruments to be used in monitoring cognitive as well as behavioural outcomes for people with intellectual disability and depressive disorders.			2009				646
High-dose vitamin K supplementation reduces fracture incidence in postmenopausal women: a review of the literature		Iwamoto, J., Sato, Y., Takeda, T. and Matsumoto, H.				nutrition research (new york, n.y.)	nutrition research (new york, n.y.)	"Although systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have concluded that vitamin K is effective in preventing fractures, the effect of vitamin K on the skeleton remains a matter of controversy. The objective of the present review of the literature was to evaluate the effect of vitamin K supplementation on the skeleton of postmenopausal women. PubMed was used to search the reliable literature for RCTs by using the search terms ""vitamin K(1) or vitamin K(2),"" ""bone,"" and ""postmenopausal women"" and the following inclusion criteria: approximately 50 or more subjects per group and study period of 2 years or longer. Seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The results of these RCTs showed that vitamin K(1) and vitamin K(2) supplementation reduced serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels regardless of dose but that it had inconsistent effects on serum total osteocalcin levels and no effect on bone resorption. Despite the lack of a significant change or the occurrence of only a modest increase in bone mineral density, high-dose vitamin K(1) and vitamin K(2) supplementation improved indices of bone strength in the femoral neck and reduced the incidence of clinical fractures. The review of the reliable literature confirmed the effect of vitamin K(1) and vitamin K(2) supplementation on the skeleton of postmenopausal women mediated by mechanisms other than bone mineral density and bone turnover."			2009				354
Circulating matrix metalloproteinase-9 concentrations and abdominal aortic aneurysm presence: a meta-analysis		Takagi, H., Manabe, H., Kawai, N., Goto, S. N. and Umemoto, T.				interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery	interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery	To summarize the present evidence for an association between matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) presence, we performed a meta-analysis of case-control studies that compared circulating MMP-9 concentrations between patients with AAA and subjects without AAA. MEDLINE database was searched to identify all case-control studies. For each study, data regarding serum or plasma MMP-9 concentrations in both the AAA and control groups were used to generate standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study-specific estimates were combined using inverse variance-weighted average of logarithmic SMDs in both fixed- and random-effects models. Our search identified eight eligible studies including 580 patients with AAA and 258 subjects without AAA. Pooled analysis demonstrated significantly higher circulating MMP-9 concentrations in the AAA group than those in the control group in random-effect models (SMD, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.23-1.17; P=0.004). There was significant study heterogeneity of results (P<0.00001) but no evidence of significant publication bias (P=0.1376). We found that, based on a systematic review and meta-analysis, circulating MMP-9 concentrations are higher in patients with AAA than those in subjects without AAA. Higher circulating MMP-9 concentrations are associated with AAA presence.			2009				798
The role of lactobacillus probiotics in the treatment or prevention of urogenital infections--a systematic review		Abad, C. L. and Safdar, N.				journal of chemotherapy (florence, italy)	journal of chemotherapy (florence, italy)	Probiotics are increasingly being used to treat and prevent urogenital infections. However, a critical assessment of their efficacy in major urogenital infections is lacking. We report the results of a systematic review to determine the efficacy of probiotics for prevention or treatment of three major urogenital infections: bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and urinary tract infection. Using multiple computerized databases, we extracted data from clinical trials using a lactobacillus-containing preparation to either prevent or treat a urogenital infection. Of 25 included studies, 18 studies used lactobacillus preparations for treatment or prevention of urogenital infections and seven studies focused solely on vaginal colonization. Four studies included patients with vaginal candidiasis, five included patients with urinary tract infections, and eight included patients with bacterial vaginosis. One included several types of genitourinary infections. Overall, lactobacilli were beneficial for the treatment of patients with bacterial vaginosis. No clear benefit was seen for candidiasis or urinary tract infection. Studies were heterogeneous, with some limited by a small population size. In conclusion, the use of certain lactobacillus strains such as L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri for prevention and treatment of recurrent urogenital infection is promising, especially for recurrent bacterial vaginosis. Scant data on the use of probiotics for urinary tract infection and vulvovaginal candidiasis precludes definitive recommendations. Further research and larger studies on types of lactobacilli strains, dosage of lactobacilli, optimal route and vehicle of administration are needed.			2009				2
Therapeutic trajectory of hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroids in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis		Bannuru, R. R., Natov, N. S., Obadan, I. E., Price, L. L., Schmid, C. H. and McAlindon, T. E.				arthritis and rheumatism	arthritis and rheumatism	OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of intraarticular hyaluronic acid with corticosteroids for knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Our data sources were Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane database, as well as hand- searched reviews, manuscripts, and supplements. For unpublished data we used author contacts. Randomized trials that reported effects of intraarticular hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroids on knee OA were selected based on inclusion criteria. Two reviewers extracted data independently. Using a random-effects model, we computed effect sizes for pain change from baseline at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 26 weeks. We also performed multivariate analyses accounting for within and between-study covariance. We performed sensitivity analyses for trials that reported intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis and blinding, and directly compared Hyalgan with methylprednisolone. RESULTS: The 7 eligible trials included 606 participants. Five reported ITT analyses. At week 2 the effect size was -0.39 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], -0.65, -0.12) favoring corticosteroids; at week 4 it was -0.01 (95% CI -0.23, 0.21) suggesting equal efficacy. At week 8 the effect size was 0.22 (95% CI -0.05, 0.49) favoring hyaluronic acid, and at week 12 it was 0.35 (95% CI 0.03, 0.66) favoring hyaluronic acid. At week 26 the effect size was 0.39 (95% CI 0.18, 0.59), favoring hyaluronic acid. The multivariate analyses and sensitivity analyses generated consistent results. CONCLUSION: From baseline to week 4, intraarticular corticosteroids appear to be relatively more effective for pain than intraarticular hyaluronic acid. By week 4, the 2 approaches have equal efficacy, but beyond week 8, hyaluronic acid has greater efficacy. Understanding this trend is useful to clinicians when treating knee OA.			2009				53
Cost of liver transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the United States with other OECD countries		van der Hilst, C. S., Ijtsma, A. J., Slooff, M. J., Tenvergert, E. M. and University Medical Center Groningen, Netherlands c s van der hilst rvb umcg nl				medical care research & review	medical care research & review	Large cost variations of liver transplantation are reported. The aim of this study was to assess cost differences of liver transplantation and clinical follow-up between the United States and other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Eight electronic databases were searched, and 2,000 citations published after 1990 with more than 10 transplantations, and with original cost data, were identified. A total of 30 articles included 5,975 liver transplantations. Meta-analysis was used to derive a combined mean using a random-effects model to test for heterogeneity between studies. Estimated mean cost of a U.S. liver transplantation was US$163,438 (US$145,277-181,598) compared to US$103,548 (US$85,514-121,582) for other OECD countries. Patient characteristics, disease characteristics, quality of the health care provider, and methodology could not explain this cost difference. Health system characteristics differed between the U.S. and other OECD countries. Cost differences in liver transplantation between these two groups may be largely explained by health system characteristics.			2009				840
[LDL apheresis for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia. A systematic review]		Zechmeister, I., Mathis, S., Guba, B. and Gartlehner, G.				medizinische klinik (munich, germany : 1983)	medizinische klinik (munich, germany : 1983)	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis is indicated in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who are resistant to drug therapy. The study evaluates whether the various apheresis techniques available result in relevant improvement of clinical endpoints (cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, quality of life). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic literature review in standard databases (Medline, EMBASE, CRD York, Cochrane, and others) was conducted. Extraction of core data, assessment of study quality and evidence rating according to the GRADE method were undertaken in an internal peer-review process. RESULTS: Evidence from the ten studies included weakly indicates an improvement in angina symptoms and reduced mortality. However, due to limited study quality, no reliable answers are possible concerning the question whether LDL apheresis results in reduced cardiovascular morbidity/mortality or improved quality of life. CONCLUSION: The available evidence indicates a possible net benefit of LDL apheresis. However, since the quality of the evidence is very low, treatment should be strictly restricted to patients with severe familial hypercholesterolemia who are resistant to standard care.			2009				919
Is oral irrigation beneficial to gingival health as an adjunct to toothbrushing?		Jin, L.				evidence-based dentistry	evidence-based dentistry	DATA SOURCES: Relevant papers were identified by using Medline-PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. STUDY SELECTION: Papers were assessed for inclusion independently by two reviewers and only those published in the English language were chosen. Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCT) or controlled clinical trials (CCT) conducted in adults with good general health were selected. OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluation parameters included changes in dental plaque, gingival bleeding/ inflammation and probing pocket depth. Study quality was assessed based upon study design, evaluation period, profiles of subjects, method of randomisation, blindness of examiners and completeness of followup assessment. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted by three reviewers. As the selected studies showed considerable heterogeneity in the study designs, characteristics, outcome variables and results, a descriptive review of the data was presented instead of performing a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Seven papers (four RCT and three CCT) were included. Mean values and standard deviations were collected from the data. Data showed that oral irrigation does not reduce plaque scores more than toothbrushing or regular oral hygiene measures. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests that oral irrigation as an adjunct to toothbrushing does not have a beneficial effect in reducing dental plaque, but it may improve gingival health.			2009				369
Vitamin A supplementation during puerperium: systematic review		Caminha Mde, F., Batista Filho, M., Fernandes, T. F., Arruda, I. K. and Diniz Ada, S.				revista de sau?de pu?blica	revista de sau?de pu?blica	A systematic review on studies evaluating the effect of applying megadoses of vitamin A on the retinol concentrations in maternal milk and blood, as a short-term measure for preventing hypovitaminosis A, was conducted. Based on the strategy of the Brazilian Cochrane Center for randomized trials, 115 published papers were identified in PubMed. From these, through a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, 14 articles published between 1993 and 2007 were selected. The effects of interventions with three posological regimens (200,000, 300,000 and 400,000 IU) of vitamin A were analyzed. Out of 11 experiments conducted on maternal milk, nine presented elevation of the retinol levels in comparison with the control group; out of nine that evaluated maternal blood, four showed elevation at varying times after applying megadoses of vitamin A. It was concluded that the results from administration of vitamin A at high doses were positive in 82% of the trials on maternal milk, but less notable in relation to maternal blood. No significant differences regarding the posological regimens applied were observed.			2009				111
Point-of-care testing for patients with diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or coagulation disorders in the general practice setting: a systematic review		Gialamas, A., St John, A., Laurence, C. O. and Bubner, T. K.				family practice	family practice	BACKGROUND: Point-of-care testing (PoCT) is increasingly being used in the general practice setting and has the potential to provide improved health outcomes for patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to systematically assess the literature relating to the analytical performance, clinical effectiveness, cost and satisfaction of patients and health professionals with PoCT for monitoring patients with diabetes, with hyperlipidaemia or requiring anticoagulant therapy in general practice. METHODS: Systematic review and synthesis of randomized and quasi-randomized trials during 1966-2007 was performed. PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents, BIDS and the Cochrane Library databases were searched using key terms relating to PoCT for diabetes (glycosylated haemoglobin, urine albumin creatinine ratio), hyperlipidaemia (total cholesterol, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein) and anticoagulant therapy (international normalized ratio) in the general practice setting. RESULTS: Nine papers from six randomized or quasi-randomized trials were included in the review. Large between-study heterogeneity made pooling of the data inappropriate. In terms of clinical effectiveness, no study found a significant difference between PoCT and pathology laboratory testing. There was a similar lack of data in relation to the analytical performance of PoCT, to cost outcomes and to patient and health professional satisfaction, making conclusions difficult to infer. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review does not provide robust evidence that PoCT in general practice improves patient health outcomes, that it has comparable analytical quality to pathology laboratory testing, that it is cost-effective compared to usual care or that patients and health professionals find PoCT satisfactory. The number of trials is low, the follow-up of patients is short and many of the trials did not investigate PoCT as a separate intervention.			2010				266
The impact of mobile handheld technology on hospital physicians' work practices and patient care: a systematic review		Prgomet, M., Georgiou, A. and Westbrook, J. I.				journal of the american medical informatics association : jamia	journal of the american medical informatics association : jamia	The substantial growth in mobile handheld technologies has heralded the opportunity to provide physicians with access to information, resources, and people at the right time and place. But is this technology delivering the benefits to workflow and patient care promised by increased mobility? The authors conducted a systematic review to examine evidence regarding the impact of mobile handheld technology on hospital physicians' work practices and patient care, focusing on quantification of the espoused virtues of mobile technologies. The authors identified thirteen studies that demonstrated the ability of personal digital assistants (PDAs) to positively impact on areas of rapid response, error prevention, and data management and accessibility. The use of PDAs demonstrates the greatest benefits in contexts where time is a critical factor and a rapid response crucial. However, the extent to which these devices improved outcomes and workflow efficiencies because of their mobility was largely absent from the literature. The paucity of evidence calls for much needed future research that asks explicit questions about the impact the mobility of devices has on work practices and outcomes.			2009				666
A review of tolerability and abuse liability of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid for insomnia in patients with schizophrenia		Kantrowitz, J. T., Citrome, L. and Javitt, D. C.				clinical therapeutics	clinical therapeutics	"BACKGROUND: Approved therapeutic uses for gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) (or sodium oxybate), a gamma-aminobutyric acid type B and GHB receptor agonist, include narcolepsy in the United States and Europe and alcohol abuse treatment in Italy. Possible efficacy of GHB in schizophrenia has also been proposed. A tolerability concern regarding use of GHB is its abuse potential. Given the high comorbidity of substance disorders and schizophrenia, a systematic assessment of the published literature is crucial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to assess the tolerability and abuse liability of GHB in the context of future clinical studies as a potential treatment for insomnia in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: A literature search in English (inception through April 2009, inclusive) was conducted of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO using the search term GHB. All articles whose abstracts mentioned human use of GHB were read in their entirety. The reference sections of identified articles were reviewed for publications that might have been missed by the initial search. RESULTS: GHB is abused by a small percentage of people (<1%) as a ""club drug"" and is commonly associated with enhanced sexual experiences (65%), euphoria (41%), somnolence (71%), and confusion (24%), according to a recent study. A review of all available emergency room case series suggests that while GHB can be associated with serious coma necessitating intubation, the number of reported fatal cases associated with GHB appears limited. Clarity on the lethality of GHB is complicated by instability of GHB in postmortem samples and frequent concomitant ingestions. Furthermore, formal abuse liability studies do not support high abuse propensity for GHB, mainly because oversedation and dizziness may lead most individuals to find GHB unpleasant at high doses. As supported by 2 large studies, there is limited evidence to suggest widespread use as an agent in sexual assault. Years of clinical use in narcolepsy do not support the development of tolerance or withdrawal in those subjects without substance dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Tolerability and abuse liability issues, while a concern with GHB given its abuse potential, do not preclude further study of the potential use for insomnia in nondually diagnosed schizophrenia. Full cognizance must be taken of risk/benefit tradeoffs, and to the development of improved formulations with decreased abuse liability."			2009				384
Ambulation after deep vein thrombosis: a systematic review		Anderson, C. M., Overend, T. J., Godwin, J., Sealy, C. and Sunderji, A.				physiotherapy canada. physiothérapie canada	physiotherapy canada. physiothérapie canada	PURPOSE: To systematically review the effects of early ambulation on development of pulmonary embolism (PE) and progression or development of a new thrombus in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT). METHODS: Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to June 2008. Study quality was appraised using the Jadad and PEDro scales. Meta-analyses were reported as relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Four randomized trials were accepted. For development of a PE, the pooled relative risks for ambulation and compression versus bed rest and compression (RR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.34-1.19) and for ambulation and compression versus bed rest alone (RR = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.57-3.29) were not significant. For progression of an existing thrombus or development of a new thrombus, the independent relative risks for ambulation and compression versus bed rest and compression (RR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.13-1.14) and for ambulation and compression versus bed rest alone (RR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.20-1.57) were also not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Given the clinical benefits of mobility, and because there was no significant difference between ambulation and bed rest for risk of developing a PE or development and progression of a new DVT in any of the studies, clinicians should be confident in prescribing ambulation in this population.			2009				29
Successful complete cure en-bloc resection of large nonpedunculated colonic polyps by endoscopic submucosal dissection: a meta-analysis and systematic review		Puli, S. R., Kakugawa, Y., Saito, Y., Antillon, D., Gotoda, T. and Antillon, M. R.				annals of surgical oncology	annals of surgical oncology	BACKGROUND: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has emerged as one of the techniques to successfully resect large colonic polyps en bloc. Complete resection prevents the patient from going through transabdominal colonic resection. We sought to evaluate the proportion of successful en-bloc and complete cure en-bloc resection of large colonic polyps by ESD. METHODS: Studies that use ESD technique to resect large colonic polyps were selected. Successful en-bloc resection was defined as resection of the polyp in one piece. Successful complete cure en-bloc resection was defined as one piece with histologic disease-free-margin polyp resection. Articles were searched in Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane control trial registry. Pooled proportions were calculated by both fixed and random-effects model. RESULTS: The initial search identified 2,120 reference articles; 389 relevant articles were selected and reviewed. Data were extracted from 14 studies (n = 1,314) that met the inclusion criteria. The mean +/- standard error size of the polyps was 30.65 +/- 2.88 mm. Pooled proportion of en-bloc resection by the random-effects model was 84.91% (95% confidence interval, 77.82-90.82) and complete cure en-bloc resection was 75.39% (95% confidence interval, 66.69-82.21). The fixed-effects model was not used because of the heterogeneity of studies. CONCLUSIONS: ESD should be considered the best minimally invasive endoscopic technique in the treatment of large (>2 cm) sessile and flat polyps because it allows full pathological evaluation and cure in most patients. ESD offers an important alternative to surgery in the therapy of large sessile and flat polyps.			2009				670
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs		Trollor, J. N., Chen, X. and Sachdev, P. S.				cns drugs	cns drugs	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but potentially severe idiosyncratic adverse reaction usually seen in the context of treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Although NMS is historically associated with the classic or 'typical' antipsychotic drugs, it is also a potential adverse effect of atypical antipsychotic drugs. The widespread use of atypical antipsychotic drugs highlights the need to examine the data relating to the symptomatology, diagnosis, classification and management of NMS with these newer agents. We used MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify NMS case reports and systematic reviews published to June 2008 related to the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, amisulpride and quetiapine. Case reports and reviews were systematically examined. Our review suggests that, in general, NMS associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs manifests in a typical manner. One notable exception is clozapine-induced NMS, which appears less likely to manifest with extrapyramidal features, including rigidity and tremor. The available literature highlights the divergence of opinion relating to the core diagnostic features of NMS and its conceptualization as a categorical versus dimensional disorder. Both these issues have relevance for the identification of atypical or milder forms of NMS, which are sometimes seen with atypical antipsychotic drugs.			2009				823
[Endovascular deployment of stent graft in the ascending aorta. A systematic review]		Geiger-Gritsch, S., Piso, B., Guba, B. and Felder-Puig, R.				der chirurg; zeitschrift für alle gebiete der operativen medizen	der chirurg; zeitschrift für alle gebiete der operativen medizen	The endovascular deployment of stent graft in the ascending aorta was proposed for inclusion in the benefit catalogue of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Health. The efficacy and safety of this intervention was unclear, and therefore a systematic review was performed to support evidence-based decision making. Detailed searches for English- or German-language articles published between 2002 and 2008 were performed in a number of electronic databases. Internal validity of studies was judged by two authors independently. A total of 11 case reports but no prospective studies were identified through literature search. The case reports showed the technical feasibility of this intervention but allow no conclusions about its efficacy and safety. Therefore the endovascular deployment of stent graft in the ascending aorta must be considered as experimental and its inclusion in the benefit catalogue cannot be recommended.			2009				262
Platelet count response to H. pylori treatment in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura with and without H. pylori infection: a systematic review		Arnold, D. M., Bernotas, A., Nazi, I., Stasi, R., Kuwana, M., Liu, Y., Kelton, J. G. and Crowther, M. A.				haematologica	haematologica	Eradication of H. pylori improves thrombocytopenia in some patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura by mechanisms that remain obscure. Platelet count responses may occur independently of H. pylori infection as a result of the immune modulating effects of macrolide antimicrobials or the removal of other commensal bacteria. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the effect of H. pylori eradication therapy in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura by comparing the platelet response in patients who were, and who were not infected with H. pylori. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane central registry and abstracts from the American Society of Hematology (from 2003) were searched in duplicate and independently without language or age restrictions. Eleven studies, 8 from Japan, were included enrolling 282 patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura who received eradication therapy; 205 were H. pylori-positive and 77 were H. pylori-negative. The odds of achieving a platelet count response following eradication therapy were 14.5 higher (95% confidence interval 4.2 to 83.0) in patients with H. pylori infection (51.2% vs. 8.8%). No study reported bleeding or quality of life. Adverse events were reported in 12 patients. H. pylori eradication therapy was of little benefit for H. pylori-negative patients. These findings strengthen the causal association between H. pylori infection and immune thrombocytopenia in some patients. Randomized trials are needed to determine the applicability of H. pylori eradication therapy across diverse geographical regions.			2009				43
Do antipsychotic drugs affect brain structure? A systematic and critical review of MRI findings		Navari, S. and Dazzan, P.				psychological medicine	psychological medicine	BACKGROUND: The potential effects of antipsychotic drugs on brain structure represent a key factor in understanding neuroanatomical changes in psychosis. This review addresses two issues: (1) do antipsychotic medications induce changes in total or regional human brain volumes and (2) do such effects depend on antipsychotic type? METHOD: A systematic review of studies reporting structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures: (1) directly in association with antipsychotic use; and (2) in patients receiving lifetime treatment with antipsychotics in comparison with drug-naive patients or healthy controls. We searched Medline and EMBASE databases using the medical subject heading terms: 'antipsychotics' AND 'brain' AND (MRI NOT functional). The search included studies published up to 31 January 2007. Wherever possible, we reported the effect size of the difference observed. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. The results suggest that antipsychotics act regionally rather than globally on the brain. These volumetric changes are of a greater magnitude in association with typical than with atypical antipsychotic use. Indeed, there is evidence of a specific effect of antipsychotic type on the basal ganglia, with typicals specifically increasing the volume of these structures. Differential effects of antipsychotic type may also be present on the thalamus and the cortex, but data on these and other brain areas are more equivocal. CONCLUSIONS: Antipsychotic treatment potentially contributes to the brain structural changes observed in psychosis. Future research should take into account these potential effects, and use adequate sample sizes, to allow improved interpretation of neuroimaging findings in these disorders.			2009				589
Safety of ruling out acute pulmonary embolism by normal computed tomography pulmonary angiography in patients with an indication for computed tomography: systematic review and meta-analysis		Mos, I. C., Klok, F. A., Kroft, L. J., A, D. E. Roos, Dekkers, O. M. and Huisman, M. V.				journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : jth	journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : jth	INTRODUCTION: Several outcome studies have ruled out acute pulmonary embolism (PE) by normal computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). We performed a meta-analysis in order to determine the safety of this strategy in a specific group of patients with a strict indication for CTPA, that is, 'likely' or 'high' clinical probability for PE, an elevated D-dimer concentration, or both. METHODS: Studies that ruled out PE by normal CTPA, with or without subsequent normal bilateral compression ultrasonography (CUS), in patients with a strict indication for CTPA, were searched for in Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane dataset. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of (fatal) venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a 3-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Three studies were identified that excluded PE by CTPA alone (2020 patients), and three studies that performed additional CUS of the legs after normal CTPA (1069 patients). The pooled incidence of VTE at 3 months was 1.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-1.8] based on a normal CTPA result as a sole test, and 1.1% (95% CI 0.6-2.0) based on normal CTPA and negative CUS findings, resulting in negative predictive values of 98.8% (95% CI 98.2-99.2) and 98.9% (95% CI 98.0-99.4), respectively. This compares favorably with the VTE failure rate after normal pulmonary angiography (1.7%, 95% CI 1.0-2.7). The risk of fatal PE did not differ between the diagnostic strategies (0.6% vs. 0.5%). CONCLUSION: A normal CTPA result alone can safely exclude PE in all patients in whom CTPA is required to rule out this disease. There is no need for additional ultrasonography to rule out VTE in these patients.			2009				570
